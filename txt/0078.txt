                                                   ABSTRACT
              We estimate rates of ‚Äúabsolute income mobility‚Äù ‚Äì the fraction of children who earn more than 
              their parents ‚Äì by combining historical data from Census and CPS cross-sections with panel data 
              for recent birth cohorts from de-identified tax records. Our approach overcomes the key data 
              limitation that has hampered research on trends in intergenerational mobility: the lack of large 
              panel datasets linking parents and children. We find that rates of absolute mobility have fallen 
              from approximately 90%for children born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. The 
              result that absolute mobility has fallen sharply over the past half century is robust to the choice of 
              price deflator, the definition of income, and accounting for taxes and transfers. In counterfactual 
              simulations, we find that increasing GDP growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to 
              the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s. In contrast, changing the distribution of 
              growth across income groups to the more equal distribution experienced by the 1940 birth cohort 
              would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that reviving the 
              ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù of high rates of absolute mobility would require economic growth that is 
              spread more broadly across the income distribution.

               One of the defining  features  of  the  ‚ÄúAmerican  Dream‚Äù  is  the  ideal  that  children  have  a  higher 
               standard  of  living  than  their  parents  (Samuel  2012).  When  children  are  asked  to  assess  their 
               economic progress, they frequently compare their own standard of living to that of their parents 
               (Goldthorpe 1987, Hoschschild 2016). Such measures of absolute income mobility ‚Äì the fraction of 
               children earning or consuming more than their parents ‚Äì are also often the focus of policy makers 
               when judging the degree of economic opportunity in the U.S. (e.g., Obama 2013).1 
                       In this paper, we assess whether the U.S. is living up to this ideal by studying two questions. 
               First,  what  fraction  of  children  earn  more  than  their  parents  today?  Second,  how  have  rates  of 
               absolute mobility changed over time? Despite longstanding interest in these questions, evidence on 
               absolute income mobility remains scarce (Halikias and Reeves 2016), largely because of the lack of 
                                                                                        2
               large, high-quality panel datasets linking children to their parents in the U.S.  
                       We overcome this data problem by developing a new method of estimating rates of absolute 
               mobility that can be implemented using existing datasets covering the 1940-84 birth cohorts.  Our 
               approach  combines  two  inputs:  marginal  income  distributions  for  parents  and  children  and  the 
               copula of the parent and child income distribution, defined as the joint distribution of parent and 
               child income ranks. 
                       We estimate marginal income distributions for parents and children of the 1940-1984 birth 
               cohorts using cross-sectional data from the decennial Census and Current Population Surveys (CPS).  
               In our baseline analysis, we measure income in pre-tax dollars at the household level when parents 
               and children are approximately thirty years old, adjusting for inflation using the CPI-U-RS. We then 
               show the robustness of our results to a variety of specification choices, such as using alternative 
               inflation adjustments, adjusting for taxes and transfers, and measuring income at later ages. 
                       We estimate the fraction of children who earn more than their parents in each birth cohort by 
               combining the marginal income distributions with the copula in each cohort. For recent birth cohorts, 
               we follow Chetty et al. (2014a) and directly estimate the joint distribution of parent and child ranks 
               using information from de-identified federal income tax returns covering the U.S. population. For 
               earlier birth cohorts, such population-level panel data are not available. We instead proceed in two 
                                                                          
               1
                 In a 2013 speech on economic mobility, President Obama noted that ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs frustrations‚Äù are partly rooted ‚Äúin 
               the fear that their kids won‚Äôt be better off than they were.‚Äù 
               2
                 Prior research has studied the level of absolute income mobility for recent cohorts in the U.S. using panel surveys 
               such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (e.g., Isaacs, Sawhill, and Haskins 2008, Lopoo and DeLeire 2012; 
               Bengali and Daly 2013; Acs, Elliott, and Kalish 2016). These studies yield conflicting results because estimates of 
               absolute  mobility  using  available  panel  income  datasets  are  sensitive  to  econometric  assumptions  and  sample 
               specification (Halikias and Reeves 2016). To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence on trends in absolute 
               income mobility, although prior studies have documented declining absolute mobility in terms of occupational status 
               (Hauser et  al. 2000) and educational attainment (Hout and Janus 2011). 
                                                               1 
                                                                 
               steps. First, we report estimates of absolute mobility under the assumption that the copula remained 
               stable across all birth cohorts, a benchmark motivated by evidence of copula stability since the 1970s 
                                   3
               (Chetty et al. 2014b).  Because we have no evidence that the copula was in fact stable prior to 1970, 
               we then construct upper and lower bounds on absolute mobility for each birth cohort by searching 
                                                                          4
               over all plausible copulas using linear programming methods.  The key technical result of the paper 
               is that these bounds are very tight for the 1940-1950 birth cohorts, allowing us to obtain a reliable 
               time series on rates of absolute mobility despite the lack of historical panel data. 
                       Using this methodology, we find that rates of absolute upward income mobility in the United 
               States  have  fallen  sharply  since  1940.  Under  the  benchmark  of  copula  stability,  the  fraction  of 
               children earning more than their parents fell from 92% in the 1940 birth cohort to 50% in the 1984 
               birth cohort. Rates of absolute mobility fell the most for children with parents in the middle class. 
                       Relaxing the copula stability assumption for earlier cohorts, we find that the rate of absolute 
               mobility for the 1940 birth cohort is bounded between 84% and 98% across all plausible copulas, 
               well above the rates observed for recent cohorts. Absolute mobility is not very sensitive to the copula 
               for  the  1940  birth  cohort  because  income  grew  very  rapidly  at  all  quantiles  of  the  distribution 
               between 1940 and 1970. As a result, nearly all children earned more than the highest-income earners 
               in  their  parents‚Äô  generation,  implying  rates  of  absolute  mobility  near  100%  regardless  of  which 
               children were linked to which parents. 
                       In more recent cohorts, the copula ‚Äì i.e., which parents are linked to which children ‚Äì matters 
               much more because there has been little income growth across most of the distribution since 1980. 
               For the 1984 cohort, the bounds on absolute mobility under alternative copulas span 14% to 88%. 
               Fortunately, the copula is directly observed for these cohorts in tax records. In short, the key piece of 
               missing data that has hampered direct measurement of absolute mobility ‚Äì the lack of historical panel 
               data linking parents and children ‚Äì turns out to be inessential for characterizing trends in mobility. 
                       The  marked  decline  in  absolute  mobility  since  1940  is  robust  to  a  range  of  alternative 
               specifications. Most importantly, the qualitative results do not change when we account for potential 
               changes in the quality of goods and new product innovation, which could have important effects on 
               real income. Prior work on bias due to new products in inflation indices suggests that the annual 
                                                                          
               3  Copula stability implies that relative mobility ‚Äì the correlation between children‚Äôs earnings and their parents‚Äô 
               earnings ‚Äì has not changed over time. Several studies have documented that relative mobility has not changed 
               significantly in recent decades using both transition matrices (copulas) and other statistics such as intergenerational 
               elasticities of income and rank-rank correlations (e.g., Lee and Solon 2009, Hauser 2010, Chetty et al. 2014b). 
               4 We define the set of ‚Äúplausible‚Äù copulas as copulas under which the distribution of children‚Äôs incomes is weakly 
               increasing with their parents‚Äô incomes (in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance). This restriction rules out 
               perverse copulas that generate negative intergenerational income persistence.  
                                                              2 
                                                                
       inflation rate measured by the CPI-U-RS may be biased upward by 0.8% (Meyer and Sullivan 2009, 
       Broda and Weinstein 2010). Subtracting 0.8% from the inflation rate each year, we find that absolute 
       mobility declined from 93% to 59% between the 1940 and 1984 cohorts. We also obtain similar 
       results when we (a) use post-tax and post-transfer measures of income instead of pre-tax measures, 
       (b) calculate children‚Äôs incomes at age 40 (for the 1940-74 birth cohorts) instead of age 30, and (c) 
       adjust for changes in family size over time. Other metrics for upward mobility, such as the ratio of 
       children‚Äôs income to their parents‚Äô incomes, also exhibit similar declines.  
          We find robust evidence of declines in absolute mobility across subgroups. Absolute mobility 
       fell in all 50 states between the 1940 and 1980 cohorts, although the rate of decline varied, with the 
       largest declines concentrated in states in the industrial Midwest states such as Michigan and Illinois. 
       We also find substantial declines in absolute mobility for both sons and daughters when income is 
       measured at the household level. The decline in absolute mobility is especially steep ‚Äì from 95% in 
       the 1940 cohort to 41% in the 1984 cohort ‚Äì when we compare the individual earnings of sons to 
       their fathers. 
          Why have rates of upward income mobility fallen so sharply over the past half century?  
       There have been two important macroeconomic trends that have affected the incomes of children 
       born in the 1980s relative to those born in the 1940s: lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth 
       rates and greater inequality in the distribution of growth (Goldin and Katz 2008). We consider two 
       counterfactual scenarios to assess the relative contribution of these two factors. 
          First, we consider a ‚Äúhigher GDP growth‚Äù scenario, in which children in the 1980 cohort 
       experience GDP growth from birth to age 30 that is comparable to what was experienced by the 1940 
       cohort,  but  GDP is  distributed in  proportion to  GDP shares by income  percentile in 2010. This 
       counterfactual expands the size of the economic pie, dividing it in the proportions by which it is 
       divided today. In this scenario, absolute mobility rises to 62%, closing 29% of the gap in absolute 
       mobility  between  the  1940  and  1980  birth  cohorts.  Thus,  the  slowdown  in  aggregate  economic 
       growth in recent decades, although important, does not explain most of the observed decline in 
       absolute mobility. 
          Second, we consider a ‚Äúmore broadly shared growth‚Äù scenario, in which the actual GDP in 
       2010 is allocated across income percentiles as it was in the 1940 cohort. This counterfactual keeps 
       the size of the economic pie fixed at its observed level, but divides it more evenly, as in the past. In 
       this scenario, the rate of absolute mobility rises to 80%, closing 71% of the gap in absolute mobility 
       between the 1940 and 1980 cohorts. 
                            3 
                              
                       Together,  these  counterfactual  simulations  show  that  increasing  GDP  growth  without 
               changing the current distribution of growth would have modest effects on rates of absolute mobility. 
               Under the current distribution of GDP, we would need real GDP growth rates above 6% per year to 
               return to the rates of absolute mobility seen in the 1940s.  Intuitively, because a large fraction of 
               GDP  goes  to  a  small  number  of  high  income  earners  today,  higher  GDP  growth  does  not 
               substantially increase the number of children who earn more than their parents. Of course, this does 
               not mean that GDP growth does not matter: changing the distribution of growth naturally has smaller 
                                                                                          5
               effects on absolute mobility when there is very little growth to be distributed.  The key point is that 
               reviving  the  ‚ÄúAmerican  Dream‚Äù  of  high  rates  of  absolute  mobility  would  require  more  broadly 
               shared economic growth rather than just higher GDP growth rates. 
                       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I summarizes our methodology 
               and data sources. Section II provides baseline estimates under the benchmark assumption of a stable 
               copula. Section III establishes the key result that estimates of absolute mobility for early cohorts are 
               insensitive  to  the  copula.  Section  IV  assesses  the  sensitivity  of  the  results  to  alternative  price 
               deflators and other specification choices, and presents results on heterogeneity by gender and state. 
               Section  V  presents  the  counterfactuals,  and  Section  VI  concludes.  Details  on  the  methods  and 
               supplementary results are presented in the Supplementary Appendix. Code to replicate the results and

               across spouses) at age 30. We measure incomes in 2014 dollars, adjusting for inflation using the CPI-
                                     6
               U-RS (research series).  In sensitivity analyses, discussed in Section IV, we consider several variants 
               of this income concept: using alternative price deflators, measuring income at age 40, measuring 
               income after taxes and transfers, and adjusting for family size. 
                       We define the rate of absolute mobility in cohort c, Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µ, as the fraction of children in cohort c 
               that earn more than their parents:  
                                                                          
               5 Moreover, policies that promote higher GDP growth could also lead to more broadly distributed growth. 
               6 The CPI-U-RS is available from 1977 onward. Prior to 1977, we use the CPI-U multiplied by the ratio of the CPI-
               U-RS to the CPI-U in 1977 to rescale the CPI-U in previous years.

                           marginal distributions of parent and child income and the joint distribution of the ranks (the copula).

                           Intuitively, a child with rank Ì±üÌ†µ  earns more than her parent with rank Ì±üÌ†µ  if the Ì±üÌ†µ -th quantile of the 
                           child‚Äôs income distribution is higher than the Ì±üÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µ-th quantile of the parent‚Äôs income distribution, i.e.

                                        Equation (2) shows that absolute mobility can be calculated by estimating (a) the marginal 
                           income distribution for children (which yields Ì±ÑÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µ), (b) the marginal income distributions for parents

                           (which yields  Ì±ÑÌ†µ ),  and  (c)  the  copula,  Ì∞∂Ì†µ                             Ì±üÌ†µ  , Ì±üÌ†µ   .  The  rest  of  this  section  summarizes  how  we

                           estimate these three distributions; a detailed description is provided in the Supplementary Appendix. 
                            
                           Children‚Äôs Marginal Income Distributions. We obtain marginal income distributions at age 30 for 
                           children  in  the  1940-1984  birth  cohorts  directly  from  the  1970-2014  March  Current  Population 
                           Surveys (CPS). The sample of children includes U.S.-born members of the 1940-84 birth cohorts 
                           who, at age 30, were present in the U.S. and not institutionalized. We exclude immigrants in order to 
                           have a consistent sample in which we observe both parents‚Äô and children‚Äôs incomes.7 We compute 
                           family income as the sum of spouses‚Äô personal pre-tax income. 
                                                                                      
                           7 The CPS does not ask for respondents‚Äô birthplace prior to 1994; hence, for children born before 1964, we cannot 
                           exclude immigrants from the sample. Most of the growth in the foreign-born share of the population occurred in 
                           recent decades, limiting the bias created by the inclusion of immigrants in early cohorts (National Academy of 
                                                                                                                5 
                                                                                                                  
                
               Parents‚Äô Marginal Income Distributions. Estimating the income distributions of parents at age 30 
               who have children in a given birth cohort is more complicated because of the lack of historical panel 
               data. We construct parents‚Äô income distributions for children in each of the 1940-84 birth cohorts by 
               pooling  data  from  Census  cross-sections  between  1940  and  2000  (using  the  1  percent  IPUMS 
               samples). In order to cover all parents using decennial Censuses, we estimate parents‚Äô incomes when 
               the highest earner is between the ages of 25 and 35, a symmetric window around age 30.8 
                      For example, we estimate the income distribution of parents of children in the 1970 birth 
               cohort as follows. First, we use the 1970 Census and select parents between the ages of 25 and 35 
               who have a child less than one year old in 1970. Next, we turn to the 1980 Census and select parents 
               between the ages of 26 and 35 who have ten year old children (i.e., individuals who had a child in 
               1970 when they were between the ages of 16 and 25).9 Third, to identify parents between ages 35 and 
               45 who had children less than one year old in 1970, we turn to the 1960 Census and select all 
               individuals aged 25-35. We give this group a weight equal to the fraction of individuals in the 1970 
               Census between the ages of 35 and 45 who have a child less than one year old in 1970. This 
               approach  assumes  that  the  income  distribution  of  those  who  have  children  after  age  35  is 
               representative  of  the  income  distribution  of  the  general  population.  Such  an  assumption  is 
               unavoidable as one cannot identify parents who will have children in the future in cross-sectional 
               data. Fortunately, this assumption turns out to be inconsequential in practice because most children 
                                                10
               are born before their parents are 35.   
                      We estimate income distributions for parents with children in each of the other birth cohorts 
               from 1940-1984 using an analogous approach. Summary statistics on parents‚Äô and children‚Äôs incomes 
               by birth cohort are reported in Table S1. 
                
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
               Sciences,  Engineering,  and  Medicine  2015).  Moreover,  because  immigrants‚Äô  earnings  are  lower  than  natives‚Äô 
               earnings on average, this bias likely reduces our estimates of absolute mobility in the early cohorts, rendering our 
               estimate of the amount of decline more conservative than the true decline for natives. 
               8 The measures of total pre-tax income available in the Census change over time. From 1970 onward, we use the 
               sum of spouses‚Äô personal pre-tax income minus income from public assistance. In 1960, we use the sum of spouses‚Äô 
               personal pre-tax income. In 1950, we use total family income. In 1940, only income from wages and salaries is 
               available, along with an indicator for non-wage, non-salary income, which we use to impute non-wage income. See 
               the Supplementary Appendix for further details. 
               9 For simplicity, we restrict attention to individuals who have children between the ages of 16 and 45 throughout our 
               analysis. 
               10 In the Supplementary Appendix, we show that restricting attention to parents who have children between the ages 
               of 25 and 35 ‚Äì thereby avoiding this assumption entirely ‚Äì yields very similar results.

                   Copula. For children born in the 1980s, we estimate a non-parametric copula ‚Äì a 100 x 100 matrix 
                                                                                      ( Ì±òÌ†µ   Ì±ùÌ†µ)
                   giving the probability of each child and parent rank pair  Ì±üÌ†µ ,Ì±üÌ†µ            ‚Äì exactly as in Chetty et al. (2014a,

                   to parents based on dependent claiming on tax forms.   
                            For both parents and children, we define family income in the tax records in a manner that is 
                   as similar to the measures in the CPS and Census as possible. For those who file tax returns, we 
                   define income as aggregate gross income (AGI) plus the non-taxable portion of Social Security and 
                   Disability Income. For non-filers, we measure income using third-party information returns, defining 
                   income  as  the  sum  of  the  W-2  wage  earnings,  Social  Security  and  Disability  Income,  and 
                                                            12
                   Unemployment Insurance income.  If individuals do not file a tax return and have no information 
                                                                                       13
                   returns filed on their behalf, taxable income is coded as 0.  
                            Following Chetty et al. (2014a), we measure children‚Äôs incomes as mean income in 2011 and 
                   2012, when children in the 1980-82 birth cohorts are between the ages of 30 and 32. We measure 
                   parents‚Äô incomes as mean taxable income between 1996 and 2000, the first five years in which 
                                                              14
                   population tax records are available.  Parents are between the ages of 30 and 60 when we measure 
                   their incomes because we limit the sample to parents who have children between the ages of 15 and 
                   40 in 1980-82. Chetty et al. (2014a) show that the distribution of income ranks is stable between the 
                   ages of 30 and 60. Because of this rank stability, this approach provides an accurate estimate of the 
                   copula that one would obtain if one could observe income ranks at age 30 for all parents. 
                            We exclude parents with zero or negative income when constructing the copula because 
                   parents with no earnings typically do not file a tax return and hence cannot be linked to their children 
                   based on dependent claiming. This does not pose a problem for measuring absolute mobility because 
                   children whose parents have zero income always earn at least as much as their parents. We calculate 
                   the fraction of parents with zero income in each cohort based on Census data and  include these 
                                                                              
                   11 This definition of ‚Äúparents‚Äù ‚Äì based on who claims a child as a dependent ‚Äì differs from the biological definition 
                   of parents used in the CPS and Census. Using birth certificate data to link parents to children yields very similar 
                   estimates of the copula (not reported). The population in the tax data also differs slightly from that in the CPS and 
                   Census because it includes institutionalized individuals. 
                   12 For non-filers, we cannot include the spouse‚Äôs income. However, the vast majority of non-filers of working age 
                   are single (Cilke 1998). 
                   13  Importantly,  these  observations  are  true  zeros  rather  than  missing  data.  Because  the  dataset  includes  all  tax 
                   records, we know that these individuals have 0 taxable income. 
                   14 Chetty et al. (2014a) use multi-year averages of income to mitigate the influence of transitory income fluctuations; 
                   however, they show (Chetty et al., Appendix Figure IID) that using annual income measures yields very similar 
                   estimates of rank distributions because the degree of transitory variance in income ranks is small in tax records. 
                                                                              7 
                                                                                
                   individuals  when  computing average rates of absolute mobility,  assigning  the  group  of  children 
                   whose parents have zero income an absolute mobility rate of 100%. 
                            We define children‚Äôs percentile ranks Ì±üÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µ based on their incomes relative to other children in 
                                                                          Ì±ñÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µ
                   their birth cohort. We include children with 0 income when constructing these ranks, breaking ties at 
                              15
                   the mean.  Likewise, parents are assigned percentile ranks based on their incomes relative to other 
                   parents (among those with positive income). The copula is then estimated as a 100√ó100 matrix that 
                                                                                          ( Ì±òÌ†µ   Ì±ùÌ†µ)
                   gives the joint probability of each child and parent rank pair  Ì±üÌ†µ ,Ì±üÌ†µ          .  
                            For children born before 1980, we lack the panel data necessary to estimate the copula. 
                   Chetty et al. (2014b) use a 0.1% IRS Statistics of Income panel to show that the copula (relative 
                   mobility, measured by percentile ranks) is approximately stable from the 1971 birth cohort to the 
                                        16
                   1984 birth cohort.  Motivated by this result, we begin by assuming copula stability across all cohorts 
                   since 1940, applying the copula estimated for the 1980-82 cohorts to all cohorts.  We then compute 
                   bounds on absolute mobility searching over alternative copulas, as there is no empirical evidence that 
                   copula stability holds going back to 1940. 
                    
                   II. Baseline Estimates 
                    
                            This  section  presents  our  baseline  estimates  of  absolute  mobility,  which  assume  copula 
                   stability from 1940-84 and measure family income in real pre-tax dollars at age 30. Figure 1A plots 
                   rates of absolute mobility by parental income percentile for the decadal birth cohorts, 1940-1980. 
                   Each series  shows  the  percentage  of  children  earning  more  than  their  parents  vs.  their  parents‚Äô 
                   income percentile, limiting the sample to parents with positive income. 
                            In  the  1940  birth  cohort,  nearly  all  children  grew  up  to  earn  more  than  their  parents 
                   regardless of their parental income. Naturally, rates of absolute mobility were lower at the highest 
                   parental income levels, as children have less scope to do better than their parents if their parents had 
                   very high incomes. 
                            Rates of absolute mobility have fallen substantially since 1940, especially for families in the 
                   middle and upper class. At the 10th percentile of the parental income distribution, children born in 
                   1940 had a 94% chance of earning more than their parents, compared with 70% for children born in 
                                                                              
                   15 For example, if 10% of a birth cohort has 0 income, all children with 0 income receive a percentile rank of 5. 
                   16 The 0.1% sample used by Chetty et al. (2014b) is adequate to assess the stability of the copula using statistics such 
                   as rank-rank correlations and quintile probabilities, but it is not sufficiently large to directly estimate the 100 x 100 
                   percentile copula for each birth cohort from 1971-84. This is why we use the 1980 copula estimated from the 
                   population tax data for all cohorts. 
                                                                              8 
                                                                                
                                  1980. At the 50th percentile, rates of absolute mobility fell from 93% for children born in 1940 to 
                                  45% for those born in 1980. And at the 90th percentile, rates of absolute mobility fell from 88% to 
                                  33% over the same period. 
                                                  Figure 1B aggregates the rates of absolute mobility across parental incomes (including those 
                                  with zero income) and plots average absolute mobility (Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µ) for each birth cohort from 1940-1984. 
                                  Absolute mobility declined starkly across birth cohorts: on average, 92% of children born in 1940 
                                  grew up to earn more than their parents. In contrast, only 50% of children born in 1984 grew up to 
                                  earn more than their parents. The downward trend in absolute mobility was especially sharp between 
                                  the 1940 and 1964 cohorts. The decline paused for children born in the late 1960s and early 1970s, 
                                  whose incomes at age 30 are measured in the midst of the economic boom  of the late 1990s. 
                                  Absolute mobility then continued to fall steadily in the remaining birth cohorts. 
                                   
                                  III. Bounds Under Alternative Copulas 
                                   
                                                  We now assess the sensitivity of the estimates reported in Figure 1 to the assumption that the 
                                  copula remained stable at the values observed for the 1980 birth cohort going back to 1940. We do so 
                                  by deriving bounds on the rate of absolute mobility in each birth cohort, searching over all copulas 
                                  Ì∞∂Ì†µ (Ì±üÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µ, Ì±üÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µ), defined non-parametrically by a 100 x 100 percentile-level matrix.  
                                    Ì±êÌ†µ            We restrict attention to copulas satisfying the intuitive requirement that children from higher 
                                  income  families  are  less  likely  to  have  lower  incomes.  Formally,  we  assume  that  the  income 
                                  distribution of children with higher-income parents first-order stochastically dominates (FOSD) the 
                                  income distribution of children from lower income families: 
                                                                                   Ì±üÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µ      (         Ì±ùÌ†µ)                                                              Ì±ùÌ†µ                   Ì±òÌ†µ
                                                                                ‚à´ Ì∞∂Ì†µ Ì±üÌ†µ,Ì±üÌ†µ                  Ì±ëÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µ is weakly decreasing in Ì±üÌ†µ  for all Ì±üÌ†µ   (3) 
                                                                                  0        Ì±êÌ†µ
                                                  For each birth cohort, we calculate bounds on absolute mobility by solving for the copulas 
                                  Ì∞∂Ì†µ (Ì±üÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µ, Ì±üÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µ)  that  minimize  and  maximize  Ì∞¥Ì†µ ,  as  defined  in  equation  (2),  given  the  empirically 
                                    Ì±êÌ†µ                                                                        Ì±òÌ†µ( Ì±òÌ†µ)             Ì±êÌ†µ      Ì±ùÌ†µ( Ì±ùÌ†µ)
                                  observed marginal distributions, Ì±ÑÌ†µ                                              Ì±üÌ†µ       and  Ì±ÑÌ†µ            Ì±üÌ†µ     .  We impose two sets of constraints on this 
                                                                                                             Ì±êÌ†µ                     Ì±òÌ†µ    Ì±êÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µ
                                  problem: the FOSD requirements for each (Ì±üÌ†µ ,Ì±üÌ†µ ) pair in (3) and integration constraints requiring 
                                  that the columns and rows of Ì∞∂Ì†µ (Ì±üÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µ,Ì±üÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µ) sum to 1. This optimization problem has 100 x 100 = 10,000 
                                                                                                   Ì±êÌ†µ
                                  arguments, which might appear to be computationally intractable. Fortunately, since the objective 
                                  function in (2) and all the constraints are linear, this problem can be solved rapidly using a standard 
                                  linear programming algorithm. 
                                                                                                                                            9 
                                                                                                                                              
               The  results  of  this  bounding  exercise  are  presented  in  Figure  2A.  The  series  in  circles 
          reproduces the baseline estimates under the assumption of copula stability shown in Figure 1B. The 
          dashed lines show the upper and lower bounds on absolute mobility. The bounds are very tight in 
          early cohorts but grow much wider for more recent cohorts. For example, for the 1940 birth cohort, 
          the bounds on absolute mobility span only 84% to 98%. In contrast, for the 1984 birth cohort, the 
          bounds span 14% to 88%.  
               The dashed vertical line in Figure 2A demarcates the point after which the copula is known to 
          be stable based on the analysis of tax records in Chetty et al. (2014b). Quite conveniently, the panel 
          data necessary to estimate the copula happen to be available for precisely the cohorts where the 
          bounds are least informative. For earlier cohorts, where the data needed to estimate the copula are 
          missing, the bounds are quite narrow and the copula therefore proves to be unimportant. The upshot 
          of Figure 2A is that even though we cannot identify the copula in early cohorts, we can be certain 
          that absolute mobility has declined sharply since the 1940s. 
               The rest of this section explains why the bounds are tight in the 1940-50 cohorts but grow 
          wider in more recent cohorts. To begin, Figure 2B plots the marginal distribution of income for 
          children in the 1940 birth cohort and their parents. Income grew very rapidly across all quantiles of 
          the income distribution between 1940 and 1970. As a result, there is very little overlap between the 
          income distributions of children born in 1940 and their parents. For example, a child born to parents 
               th                                            th
          at the 80  percentile of the parent income distribution needed to reach just the 14  percentile of the 
          children‚Äôs  income  distribution  to  exceed  her  parent‚Äôs  income.  In  the  extreme  case  in  which  the 
          distribution of child income lies everywhere above the distribution of parental income ‚Äì i.e., the 
          poorest child earns more than the richest parent ‚Äì absolute mobility would be 100% irrespective of 
          which children are linked to which parents. Although the 1940 parent and child income distributions 
          are not fully separated, we show below that they are sufficiently close to this scenario to render the 
          copula unimportant for calculating absolute mobility.  
               In contrast, recent cohorts experienced much less growth across most quantiles of the income 
          distribution (e.g., Goldin and Katz 2008, Autor 2014). Figure 2C illustrates this point by replicating 
          Figure 2B for the 1980 birth cohort. Because growth rates were much lower between 1980 and 2010, 
          there is  substantial  overlap  between  parents‚Äô  and  children‚Äôs  income  distributions  (at age  30)  for 
          children born in 1980. Children with parents at the 80th percentile of the income distribution now 
                      th
          need to reach the 74  percentile of their cohort‚Äôs income distribution to earn more than their parents. 
               Figure 2D shows why the greater degree of overlap between children‚Äôs and parents‚Äô income 
          distributions in recent cohorts leads to wider bounds on absolute mobility. The curves in this figure 
                                        10 
                                          
                plot the income rank a child must reach to earn more than her parents as a function of her parents‚Äô 
                income percentile, separately for the 1940 and 1980 birth cohorts. For example, in order to earn more 
                                      th                                          th
                than parents at the 80  percentile, children need to reach the 14  percentile in the 1940 cohort and 
                      th
                the 74  percentile in the 1980 cohort, as shown in Figures 2B and 2C.                         ( Ì±òÌ†µ  Ì±ùÌ†µ)
                        The copula can be visualized in Figure 2D as the distribution of mass within the  Ì±üÌ†µ ,Ì±üÌ†µ       
                square. Absolute mobility Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µ can be calculated by summing the mass in the copula that lies above the 
                relevant curve. The empirically observed copula for the 1980-82 cohorts used in our baseline analysis 
                is shown by the shading in the figure, with darker colors representing areas with higher density. The 
                mass is clustered around the diagonal, reflecting positive intergenerational persistence of income. 
                Absolute mobility is 50% for the 1980 cohort because half of the mass of this copula lies above the 
                curve plotted for the 1980 cohort. 
                        Our bounding procedure minimizes and maximizes the amount of mass in the copula that 
                falls above the curves in Figure 2D, subject to the FOSD and integration constraints specified above. 
                Since the child rank required to beat parents is very close to the 45-degree line for the 1980 cohort, 
                rates of absolute mobility are very sensitive to whether the mass in the copula lies just above or 
                below the diagonal. This shows why we obtain wide bounds when searching over all copulas for the 
                             17
                1980 cohort.  In contrast, because the child rank required to earn more than parents is very low at 
                nearly  all  percentiles  of  the  parent  income  distribution  for  the  1940  cohort,  all  feasible  copulas 
                generate high levels of absolute mobility for that cohort. 
                 
                IV. Sensitivity and Heterogeneity Analysis 
                 
                        In this section, we first assess the sensitivity of our baseline estimates to key specification 
                choices, such as the price deflator and definition of income. We then examine heterogeneity in trends 
                in absolute mobility across subgroups. 
                 
                Sensitivity Analysis. We begin by considering alternative price deflators. Prior work has argued that 
                the CPI-U-RS may overstate inflation by failing to account adequately for improvements in product 
                quality and for the introduction of new goods (Boskin et al. 1996, Broda et al. 2009). Prior work on 
                the measurement of trends in poverty recommends subtracting 0.8 percentage points from the annual 
                                                                           
                17 The copulas for the 1980 cohort used to produce the upper and lower bounds in Figure 2A are displayed in Figure 
                S1. The copula that generates the upper bound concentrates mass just below the 1980 curve shown in Figure 2D, 
                while the copula that generates the lower bound concentrates mass just above that curve. 
                                                                  11 
                                                                    
               inflation rate implied by the CPI-U-RS to account for such biases (Meyer and Sullivan 2009, Broda 
               and Weinstein 2010). The series in squares in Figure 3A replicates the baseline series on absolute 
               mobility  by  cohort  in  Figure  1B  using  this  adjusted  price  index.  As  expected,  this  adjustment 
               increases absolute mobility in recent cohorts, as it increases real income growth rates across the 
               distribution.  However,  the  magnitude  of  the  change  is  small:  with  the  adjusted  series,  absolute 
               mobility falls from 93% in 1940 to 59% in the 1984 cohort. Even subtracting 2 percentage points 
               from the inflation rate implied by the CPI-U-RS ‚Äì a conservative adjustment larger than virtually all 
               existing estimates of the bias due to new goods ‚Äì still results in a 26 percentage point decline in 
               absolute mobility from 1940-1984 (Figure S2). 
                       We  also  consider  a  variety  of  other  commonly  used  price  indices:  (a)  the  Personal 
               Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCEPI), an index that includes a broader bundle of goods 
               than the CPI; (b) the Producer Price Index (PPI), an index constructed based on prices at the producer 
               level; (c) the GDP deflator, an index that covers all goods used domestically; and (d) the CPI-U 
                                                                      18
               series that is most commonly used to measure inflation.  All of these alternative indices produce 
               time series of absolute mobility very similar to our baseline estimates (Figure 3A, Figure S2). 
                       Our baseline analysis uses pre-tax measures of earnings rather than net income after taxes 
               and  transfers.  Conceptually,  it  is  not  clear  which  of  these  income  definitions  provides  a  better 
               measure of absolute mobility, as individuals‚Äô sense of progress might differ if they achieve upward 
               mobility  through  government  transfers  rather  than  their  own  earnings.  We  assess  whether  the 
               distinction matters empirically in Figure 3B by replicating our baseline analysis using post-tax and 
               transfer incomes. We estimate tax liabilities for parents and children using the National Bureau of 
               Economic Research TAXSIM model, which is available since 1960. Before 1960, we use data on 
               federal marginal tax rates, adjusted for personal exemptions by marital status and number of children, 
               applying the data in Wilson (2002). We estimate the value of transfers as the sum of Aid to Families 
               with Dependent Children, General Assistance, Supplemental Security Income, and the cash value of 
                                19
               in-kind transfers.  Accounting for taxes and transfers increases the level of absolute mobility by 
               around  3  percentage  points  in  all  cohorts,  but  does  not  affect  the  trend  in  absolute  mobility 
               appreciably. This is because taxes and transfers affect the incomes of both parents and their children, 
                                                                          
               18  The  CPI-U-RS  (research  series)  adjusts  the  CPI-U  by  correcting  for  substitution  between  existing  products 
               following Boskin et al. (1996), and generates inflation rates about 0.5% lower than the CPI-U. 
               19 We obtain estimates of in-kind transfers from Fox et al. (2015), who estimate total benefits from SNAP, WIC, 
               housing assistance, the School Lunch Program, and LIHEAP by combining CPS and administrative data. These data 
               are available starting in 1967; we do not account for in-kind transfers before 1967. Meyer, Mok, and Sullivan (2015) 
               show that transfers are under-reported by approximately 50% in survey data; we find that doubling the amount of 
               transfers reported does not affect our estimates significantly. 
                                                              12 
                                                                
               and because the expansion of transfer programs in recent years has targeted the bottom of the income 
               distribution, where rates of absolute mobility are already high even in pre-tax terms (Figure 1A). 
                       In our baseline analysis, we measure children‚Äôs incomes at age 30. One may be concerned 
               that children take a longer time to reach peak lifecycle earnings in more recent cohorts, which could 
               lead to a spurious downward trend in rates of absolute mobility. Figure 3C addresses this concern by 
               replicating our baseline analysis measuring income at age 40 for children (for the 1940-74 cohorts) 
               and at ages 35-45 for parents. This series continues to exhibit a sharp decline in absolute mobility 
               across birth cohorts. The time pattern of the decline is shifted backward by approximately 10 years, 
               consistent with measuring incomes 10 years later. 
                       The fraction of individuals who are married at age 30 and the size of families have both 
               fallen steadily in recent decades (Parker 2015). One widely used approach to adjusting for changes in 
               household size is to divide family income by the square root of the number of family members in the 
               household (e.g., Johnson et al. 2005). Figure 3D shows that when we divide our baseline income 
               measures by the square root of family size, rates of absolute mobility fall from 93% in 1940 to 60% 
                        20
               in  1984.   As  an  alternative  approach,  one  can  measure  income  at  the  individual  rather  than 
               household level. The series in triangles in Figure 3D compares the individual earnings of sons to their 
               fathers, as in prior studies of intergenerational mobility (e.g., Lee and Solon 2009). Here, we find a 
               steeper decline in absolute mobility than in our baseline specification: the fraction of sons earning 
               more than their fathers fell from 95% in 1940 to 41% in 1984. Together, these results show that 
               accounting  for  trends  in  family  size  and  the  number  of  earners  does  not  affect  the  qualitative 
               conclusion that absolute mobility has fallen substantially. 
                       Beyond the specific factors considered above, one may be concerned that levels of absolute 
               mobility for recent cohorts may still be understated because of increases in fringe benefits, non-
               market goods, or under-reporting of income in the CPS (Bollinger et al. 2015, Piketty, Saez, and 
               Zucman 2016).  As  an  omnibus  approach  to  assessing  the  potential  bias  from  such  factors,  we 
               recalculate absolute mobility for the 1984 birth after increasing each child‚Äôs income by various fixed 
               dollar amounts. Adding $1,000 to every child‚Äôs income in 2014 would increase absolute mobility for 
               the 1984 cohort to 51% from the baseline estimate of 50%; adding $10,000 would increase absolute 
               mobility to only 61% (Figure S4). These calculations show that plausible adjustments to children‚Äôs 
               incomes are unlikely to change the conclusion that absolute mobility has fallen sharply from the rates 
               of 80-90% experienced by children born in the 1940s and 1950s. 
                                                                          
               20 Even the most conservative adjustment of dividing by the total number of people in the family continues to show 
               a 26 percentage point decline in absolute mobility (Figure S3). 
                                                              13 
                                                                 
                       In our baseline analysis, we define absolute mobility using a discrete measure of whether 
               children  earn  more  than  their  parents.  Figure  S5  shows  that  using  other  thresholds  or  a  more 
               continuous  definition  of  absolute  mobility  yields  similar  results.  Panel  A  shows  the  fraction  of 
               children earning 20% more than their parents or 20% less than their parents. Both of these thresholds 
               generate very similar declines in absolute mobility. In Panel B, we plot the median ratio of child to 
               parent income, a statistic that accounts for the magnitude of the difference between parents‚Äô and 
               children‚Äôs incomes. This statistic declines from approximately 3 in the 1940 cohort to slightly less 
               than 1 in the 1984 cohort. These results show that our findings are not sensitive to the exact metric 
               used to compare children‚Äôs earnings to their parents. 
                       Finally, in the Supplementary Appendix (Figures S6-S9), we show that the results are also 
               robust to a set of other technical issues that arise from data limitations: (a) adjusting for changes in 
               the definition of family income across Censuses; (b) including immigrants in all years to account for 
               missing data on immigrant status in early cohorts; (c) using a single Census to measure parents‚Äô 
               income instead of pooling data across multiple Censuses; and (d) using data from either the Census 
               or CPS to measure the incomes of both parents and children from a single dataset. 
                
               Heterogeneity. Next, we examine how trends in absolute mobility vary across subgroups. We begin 
               by examining heterogeneity across states. We define parents‚Äô states as based on where they live when 
               we measure their incomes (between ages 25-35). We define children‚Äôs state as their state of birth to 
               account for the possibility that children who grow up in a given state may move elsewhere as adults. 
               Since children‚Äôs state of birth is not observed in the CPS, we use the Census for both parents and 
                       21
               children.  
                       Figure 4 presents the results by state. Panel A shows absolute mobility by cohort for selected 
               states  (see  Table  S2  for  estimates  for  all  states).  Panel  B  presents  a  heat  map  of  the  change  in 
               absolute mobility  from 1940 to 1980 by  state, with darker colors representing areas with larger 
               declines.  Absolute  mobility  fell  substantially  in  all  50  states  between  the  1940  and  1980  birth 
               cohorts. Absolute mobility fell particularly sharply in the industrial Midwest, where rates of absolute 
               mobility fell by 48 percentage points in Michigan and approximately 45 percentage points in Indiana, 
                                                                          
               21 To increase precision, our state-level analysis includes all children aged 25-35 and uses the 100% Census in 1940 
               and 5% IPUMS sample in 1980. Measuring children‚Äôs incomes from ages 25-35 rather than just at age 30 creates 
               small differences in levels of absolute mobility. To adjust for these differences, we calculate the difference between 
               the baseline national estimates and population-weighted national means of our state-level estimates for each cohort, 
               and add these differences to the state-level estimates. 
                                                              14 
                                                                
               Illinois, and Ohio. The smallest declines occurred in states such as Massachusetts, New York, and 
               Montana, where absolute mobility fell by approximately 35 percentage points.  
                       Next, we examine heterogeneity by gender. When comparing children‚Äôs family incomes to 
               their  parents‚Äô  family  incomes  as  in  our  baseline  analysis,  we  find  similar  declines  in  absolute 
               mobility for sons and daughters (Figure S10). However, the patterns differ by gender when we focus 
               on individual earnings. As noted above, sons‚Äô chances of earning more than their fathers fell steeply, 
               from 95% in 1940 to 41% in 1984, underscoring the sharp decline in the economic prospects of 
               American men. In contrast, the fraction of daughters earning more than their fathers fell from 43% 
               for the 1940 birth cohort to 22% in 1960, and then rose slightly to 26% in 1984. The pattern for 
               women‚Äôs individual earnings differs because of the rise in female labor force participation rates and 
               earnings over the period we study (Figure S11).  
                       In  sum,  the  subgroup  analysis  shows  that  declines  in  absolute  mobility  have  been  a 
               systematic, widespread phenomenon throughout the United States since 1940. 
                
               V. Counterfactual Scenarios 
                
                       Why have rates of absolute income mobility fallen so sharply over the last half century, and 
               what policies can restore absolute mobility to earlier levels? We use counterfactual simulations to 
               evaluate the effects of two key trends over the past half century: declining rates of GDP growth and 
               greater inequality in the distribution of GDP (Piketty and Saez 2003, Goldin and Katz 2008). 
                       We consider two counterfactual scenarios. The first, a ‚Äúhigher GDP growth‚Äù scenario, asks 
               what would have happened to absolute mobility for the 1980 cohort if the economy had grown as 
               quickly during their lifetimes as it did in the mid-twentieth century, but with GDP distributed across 
               households as it is today. The second ‚Äúmore broadly shared growth‚Äù scenario asks the converse: what 
               if total GDP grew at the rate observed in recent decades, but GDP was allocated across households as 
               it was for the 1940 birth cohort? The first scenario expands the size of the economic pie, dividing it 
               in the proportions by which it is divided today. The second keeps the size of the pie fixed, but divides 
               it more evenly as in the past. 
                       We calculate children‚Äôs counterfactual incomes under the ‚Äúhigher GDP growth‚Äù scenario as 
                              Ì±ÇÌ†µ                                                           22
               follows. Let Ì∞∫Ì†µ  denote the observed GDP per working-age family in year t.  We first define the 
                             Ì±°Ì†µ
                                                                          
               22  We define ‚Äúworking-age families‚Äù as families with at least one member between the ages of 18 and 64. We

                         1980 cohort. We then construct a counterfactual level of GDP  per working-age family in 2010,

                         Ì∞∫Ì†µ        =Ì∞∫Ì†µ           √ó1.025 , under the assumption that real GDP per family grew at a rate of 2.5% per 
                            2010          1980
                         year from 1980 to 2010. This 2.5% growth rate is comparable to the real growth rate per working-age 
                         family  from  1940-1970, and is one percentage point per year higher than the actual annualized 
                                                                                           23
                         growth  rate  from  1980-2010  of  1.5%.   Finally,  we  define  a  counterfactual  marginal  income 
                         distribution for children in the 1980 cohort as 
                                                                                     Ì±¶Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µ,Ì∞∂Ì†µ1   =ÌºãÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µ           √óÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µ                 (4) 
                                                                                       Ì±ûÌ†µ,1980         Ì±ûÌ†µ,1980        2010
                         The counterfactual income for children at percentile q is given by the share of GDP going to 30 year 
                         olds at percentile q in 2010 multiplied by the level of GDP that would have prevailed in 2010 had 
                         children  in  the  1980  cohort  experienced  GDP  growth  from  birth  to  age  30  comparable  to  that 
                         experienced by children born in the 1940s. 
                                      For the ‚Äúmore broadly shared growth‚Äù scenario, we follow the same approach as above to 
                         calculate the share of GDP that goes to children at percentile q of the 1940 cohort in 1970, ÌºãÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µ                                                             =
                            Ì±òÌ†µ           Ì±ÇÌ†µ                                                                                                                                  Ì±ûÌ†µ,1940
                         Ì±¶Ì†µ         /Ì∞∫Ì†µ        .  We  then  apply  these  shares  to  the  observed  level  of  2010  GDP  to  construct  a 
                           Ì±ûÌ†µ,1940      1970
                         counterfactual income distribution for the 1980 birth cohort:  
                                                                                     Ì±¶Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µ,Ì∞∂Ì†µ2   =ÌºãÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µ           √óÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ÇÌ†µ                 (5) 
                                                                                       Ì±ûÌ†µ,1980         Ì±ûÌ†µ,1940        2010
                         This counterfactual represents the incomes 30 year olds would have had in 2010 if GDP in 2010 were 
                         allocated across households in the same proportions as in 1970.  
                                      After  calculating  the  counterfactual income  distributions  for  children  in the  1980  cohort, 
                             Ì±òÌ†µ,Ì∞∂Ì†µ1    100               Ì±òÌ†µ,Ì∞∂Ì†µ2   100
                         {Ì±¶Ì†µ         }       and {Ì±¶Ì†µ             }      , we use the same copula and parent marginal income distributions as 
                             Ì±ûÌ†µ,1980 Ì±ûÌ†µ=1               Ì±ûÌ†µ,1980 Ì±ûÌ†µ=1
                         above to compute counterfactual rates of absolute mobility by parent income percentile. Figure 5A 
                         presents the results. The top and bottom curves in the figure reproduce the empirical series for the 
                         1940 and 1980 cohorts from Figure 1A. The dotted and dashed series show absolute mobility rates 
                         that would have been observed for the 1980 cohort under the counterfactuals in (4) and (5). 
                                      Under the higher growth counterfactual, the mean rate of absolute mobility is 62%. This rate 
                         is 12 percentage points higher than the empirically observed value of 50% in 1980, but closes only 
                         29% of the decline relative to the 92% rate of absolute mobility in the 1940 cohort. The increase in 
                         absolute mobility is especially modest given the magnitude of the change in the aggregate economy: 
                                                                                    
                         23 The 1.5% growth rate of GDP per working-age family corresponds to total real GDP growth of 2.8% per year, 
                         while the 2.5% growth rate of GDP per working-age family corresponds to total real GDP growth of 3.8% per year. 
                                                                                                        16 
                                                                                                           
                 a growth rate of 2.5% per working-age family from 1980 to 2010 would have led to GDP of $20 
                 trillion in 2010, $5 trillion (35%) higher than the actual level. 
                         The more broadly shared growth scenario increases the average rate of absolute mobility to 
                 80%, closing 71% of the gap in absolute mobility between the 1940 and 1980 cohorts. The broadly 
                 shared growth counterfactual has larger effects on absolute mobility at the bottom of the income 
                 distribution, whereas the higher growth counterfactual has larger effects at higher income levels. 
                 Since income shares of GDP are larger for high-income individuals, higher growth rates benefit those 
                 with higher incomes the most, while a more equal distribution benefits those at the bottom the most. 
                         The results  in  Figure  5A  imply  that  much  of  the  decline  in  absolute  mobility  is  due  to 
                 changes in the distribution of growth rather than reductions in aggregate growth rates. In Figure 5B, 
                 we ask what rates of GDP growth would be necessary to return to mid-century rates of absolute 
                 mobility under today‚Äôs income distribution. We plot mean rates of upward mobility under real GDP 
                 per  family  growth  rates  from  1%  to  10%,  recalculating  Ì∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µ     and  applying  (4)  to  generate 
                                                                                  2010
                 counterfactual income distributions. Achieving rates of absolute mobility above 80% under today‚Äôs 
                 income distribution would require sustained real per-family growth greater than 5% per year (or total 
                 real GDP growth above 6.4%), well above the historical experience of the United States since World 
                 War II. 
                         To see why absolute mobility is not very responsive to the growth rate when growth is 
                 distributed unequally, consider the extreme case in which one child obtains all of the increase in 
                 GDP. In this case,  higher  GDP  growth  rates  would  have  no  effect  on  absolute  mobility.  More 
                 generally, GDP growth has larger effects on absolute mobility when growth is spread more broadly, 
                 allowing more children to achieve higher living standards than their parents. Higher GDP growth and 
                 a broader distribution of growth have a multiplicative effect on absolute mobility: absolute mobility 
                 is highest when GDP growth rates are high and growth is spread broadly across the distribution. 
                         In  the  Supplementary  Appendix,  we  show  that  similar  results  are  obtained  when  using 
                 counterfactuals for the change in incomes from 1980 to 2010 based on shares of GDP growth over 
                 that period rather than counterfactuals for the level of incomes in 2010. Measuring incomes at age 40 
                 instead of 30 also yields similar results (Figure S12). 
                         In sum, the counterfactuals show that higher growth rates alone are insufficient to restore 
                 absolute mobility to the levels observed in mid-century America. A broader distribution of income 
                                                                   17 
                                                                      
               growth is necessary to revive absolute mobility, and can itself be sufficient to reverse much of the 
                                                                              24
               decline since 1940 even if growth were to remain at current levels.   
                
               VI. Conclusion 
                
                       The analysis in this paper yields two main results. First, children‚Äôs prospects of earning more 
               than their parents have faded over the past half century in the U.S. The fraction of children earning 
               more than their parents fell from approximately 90% for children born in 1940 to around 50% for 
               children  entering  the  labor  market  today.  Absolute  income  mobility  has  fallen  across  the  entire 
               income distribution, with the largest declines for families in the middle class. These findings contrast 
               with  prior  research  showing  that  relative  mobility  ‚Äì  measured,  for  instance,  by  the  correlation 
               between parents‚Äô and children‚Äôs incomes ‚Äì remained stable in recent decades (e.g., Lee and Solon 
               2009, Chetty et al. 2014b). The measures of absolute mobility we focus on in this study differ from 
               relative mobility because they compare levels of earnings across generations by bringing in data on 
               the marginal income distributions of parents and children. Absolute mobility has fallen over time 
               while relative mobility has remained stable because income growth has stagnated across much of the 
               income distribution in recent decades. 
                       Second, most of the decline in absolute mobility is driven by the more unequal distribution of 
               economic growth in recent decades rather than the slowdown in GDP growth rates. In this sense, the 
               rise in inequality and the decline in absolute mobility are closely linked. Growth is an important 
               driver of absolute mobility, but high levels of absolute mobility require broad-based growth across 
               the income distribution. With the current distribution of income, higher GDP growth rates alone are 
               insufficient to restore absolute mobility to the levels experienced by children in the 1940s and 1950s. 
               If one wants to revive the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù of high rates of absolute mobility, then one must have 
               an interest in growth that is spread more broadly across the income distribution.                         
                                                                          
               24 Plausible changes in relative mobility (the copula) also have modest effects on average rates of absolute mobility. 
               For  example,  a  uniform  copula  ‚Äì  where  children‚Äôs  ranks  are  independent  of  their  parents‚Äô  ranks  ‚Äì  would  still 
               produce absolute upward mobility for the 1980 cohort of 50%. Greater relative mobility produces higher rates of 
               absolute mobility for children with low-income parents while reducing rates of absolute mobility for children with 
               high-income parents, leaving average absolute mobility essentially unchanged.

               Supplementary Appendix 
                
               This appendix contains three sections. Section I describes how we construct our samples and define 
               the key variables used in the baseline specifications and sensitivity analyses. Section II presents a set 
               of supplementary robustness checks that address various limitations of our data. Section III presents 
               further  detail  on  the  methods  underlying  the  counterfactual  simulations  and  supplementary 
               counterfactual results. Stata and Matlab code to reproduce all of the results in the paper from publicly 
               available data can be downloaded from www.equality-of-opportunity.org. 
                
                
               Section I: Sample Construction and Variable Definitions  
                
               We construct estimates of absolute mobility by combining three sets of data. First, we construct a 
               series  of  marginal  income  distributions  for  parents  using  the  decadal  Census  data.  Second,  we 
               construct a series of marginal income distributions for children using CPS data. Third, we construct 
               the  joint  distribution  of  parent  and  child  rank  (the  copula)  using  de-identified  data  from  federal 
               income tax returns. 
                
               In this section, we describe how we construct each of these three elements. We then discuss how we 
               combine them to estimate absolute mobility in our baseline specification. Finally, we summarize 
               supplementary data used for sensitivity analyses, such as alternative price deflators and data on taxes 
               and transfers. 
                
               A. Parents‚Äô Income Distributions 
                
               Sample Construction  
                
               We obtain  data  on  parents‚Äô  incomes  from  the  1940  to  2000  U.S.  Censuses,  retrieved  via  the 
               University of Minnesota‚Äôs Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). We use the 1% national 
               random samples provided by IPUMS (except for the state-level analysis in Figure 4, where we use 
               the 100% sample for 1940 and the 5% sample for 1980). We use the Form 1 Metro sample in 1970 
               and the Metro sample in 1980 (which are, contrary to their labels, full population samples) and the 
               unweighted samples in 1990 and 2000. 
                
               To construct a sample that can be used without weights, we restrict the 1940 and 1950 Censuses to 
               self-weighting sample-line persons and their families. Since the CPS data that we use to estimate 
               children‚Äôs  incomes does not sample institutional group quarters, we render the Census and CPS 
               samples comparable by excluding from the Census individuals residing in institutional group quarters 
               (i.e., correctional and mental institutions, as well as institutions for the elderly and the handicapped) 
               and residents of the military non-institutional group quarters. For every birth cohort from 1940 to 
               1984, we restrict our sample to parents who had children between the ages of 16 and 45 (inclusive). 
               In two-parent households, we define the ‚Äúrepresentative parent‚Äù as the spouse with the higher total 
               personal income, and use this parent‚Äôs age when restricting the sample. 
                
               We follow  the  rules  established  by  IPUMS  to  determine  parent-child  relationships,  as  well  as 
                                                           25
               whether and to whom a respondent is married.  Children for whom no parent-child link can be made 
                                                                          
               25  We determine marital status and partner using both the SPLOC and MARST variables. For more detail, see 
               https://usa.ipums.org/usa/chapter5/chapter5.shtml. 
                                                              22 
                                                                 
       ‚Äì that is, for whom both mother‚Äôs and father‚Äôs location in the household are not recorded ‚Äì are 
       dropped from the sample. 
        
       Baseline Income Definitions 
        
       Our baseline definition of family income varies across Census years because the income variables 
       change  across  the  Censuses.  A  complete  list  of  the  underlying  IPUMS-USA  variables  used  to 
       construct our measures of parental income in each Census year is given in Table S3. 
        
       In the 1970 to 2000 Census years, we define parents‚Äô family income as the sum of spouses‚Äô pre-tax 
       total personal income, minus income derived from Aid to Families with Dependent Children, General 
       Assistance, and Supplemental Security Income.  
        
       Prior  to  1970,  data  on  income  from  public  assistance  programs  is  unavailable  in  the  Census. 
       Therefore,  in  the  1960  Census,  parental  income  is  defined  simply  as  the  sum  of  spouses‚Äô  total 
       personal income. In 1950, where personal income is only available for sample-line household heads, 
       the sum of spouses‚Äô income cannot be computed. Here, we define parents‚Äô family income as the sum 
       of  the  sample-line  household  head‚Äôs  total  income,  plus  any  income  from  other  members  of  the 
       primary  family  (including  business,  farm,  and  wage  income,  as  well  as  from  other,  unspecified 
       sources).  
        
       In the 1940 Census, only data on wages and salaries is available, as well as an indicator of whether 
       respondents had more than $50 in non-wage, non-salary income. For 1940, we therefore impute 
       average  non-wage,  non-salary  income  from  the  1950  Census  (adjusted  for  inflation)  for  each 
       combination of occupation (using the detailed 1950 Census Bureau occupational classification), self-
       employed status,  race  (black,  white,  other),  and  the  indicator  for  non-wage  income  above  $50. 
       Parents‚Äô family income in 1940 thus comprises the sum of spouses‚Äô wages, as well as their imputed 
       non-wage income.  
        
       Inflation Adjustment 
        
       In  our  baseline  specifications,  we  adjust  for  inflation  using  the  Consumer  Price  Index  Research 
       Series (CPI-U-RS), available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1977 onward. For all prior 
       years, we follow the Census Bureau in applying the 1977 CPI-U-RS-to-CPI-U ratio to the CPI-U of 
       previous years. Since income in Census and CPS refers to income earned in the previous calendar 
       year, inflation adjustments are also applied to that calendar year. For instance, in the 1960 Census, 
       income refers to income earned in 1959; our inflation adjustment thus pertains to 1959 U.S. dollars. 
        
       Construction of Marginal Distributions 
        
       As described in Section I of the text, we combine several Censuses to measure income between ages 
       25-35 (inclusive) for parents who had children in a given birth cohort c. In particular, we pool all 
       individuals between the ages of 25 and 35 (at the time of the survey) in the available Census samples 
       who had a child in cohort c. However, when drawing records from Censuses before year c (i.e., for 
       parents who had children after age 35), we measure the incomes of all adults between ages 25-35 and 
                            23 
                              
               assign them weight equivalent to the fraction of adults who have children in cohort c after age 35. 
                                                                                            26
               This is because we naturally cannot observe who will have children in the future.  
                
               For children born in 1940, we cannot secure income measurements from prior Censuses because 
               income data were not collected prior to the 1940 Census. We therefore use income measurements 
                                                                                            27
               from the 1940 Census itself for these older parents, pooling parents up to age 45.  Likewise, because 
               we  can  only  reach  back  to  the  1940  Census  for  the  1941-1949  birth  cohorts,  the  income 
               measurements for parents who had children in these earlier birth cohorts are also taken at slightly 
               older ages on average relative to the measurements for parents who had children more recently. 
               These age differences make it slightly more difficult for children of these early cohorts to exceed the 
               income of their parents, reducing our estimate of the decline in absolute mobility. 
                
               We compute marginal income distributions for parents of children in each birth cohort  by  first 
               estimating the cutoff values for the 100 percentile ranks and then calculating mean incomes within 
               each percentile. We exclude parents with zero income when estimating the parental marginal income 
               distribution. Parents with zero income are reintroduced in the final step of our absolute mobility 
               calculations, described in Subsection D below. 
                
               B. Children‚Äôs Income Distributions 
                
               Sample Construction  
                
               We  obtain  data  on  children‚Äôs  incomes  from  the  1970-2014  Annual  Social  and  Economic 
               Supplements of the Current Population Surveys (CPS-ASEC). We include only respondents who are 
               30 years old. We exclude all respondents who reported a birthplace outside of the United States 
               starting in 1994 (information on birthplace is unavailable prior to 1994).  
                
               Baseline Income Definitions 
                
               Children‚Äôs income is defined analogously to parents‚Äô family income, namely as the sum of spouses‚Äô 
               total personal income minus income from welfare and Supplemental Security Income. Table S4 lists 
               the variables in the IPUMS-CPS that we use to construct our measures of children‚Äôs income.  
                
               To account for the different thresholds used to top code income across different years of the CPS-
               ASEC, we use the Census Bureau‚Äôs income component rank proximity swap values for 1976-2010 
                                                                                      28
               (which are constructed using restricted CPS data that are not top-coded).  We apply this procedure 
               to all income components separately (such as wages and business income), and then sum them to 
               obtain total personal income. 
                
               Construction of Marginal Distributions 
                
                                                                          
               26 Our approach double counts the incomes of individuals who have children at exactly age 25 or 35. We adopt this 
               approach to obtain a symmetric window around age 30. Measuring incomes when parents are between ages 25 and 
               34 or 26 and 35 to avoid double counting yields estimates of absolute mobility that bracket the estimates we report. 
               27 Because we do not use data on parents‚Äô incomes from earlier Censuses, the number of observations used to 
               construct parents‚Äô income distributions for the 1940 birth cohort is lower than for subsequent cohorts (Table S1). 
               28 For further detail on this procedure, see https://cps.ipums.org/cps/income_cell_means.shtml  
                                                              24 
                                                                 
               To construct marginal income distributions for each birth cohort, we again estimate the cutoff values 
               for every percentile and then calculate mean incomes within each percentile. We account for the 
               CPS‚Äôs stratified sampling scheme by using person-level sampling weights provided for use with 
               ASEC when estimating the percentile cutoff values. 
                
               Our income estimates from our CPS-ASEC samples closely match the trends in median individual 
               income by gender published in Table P-8 of the Census Bureau‚Äôs Historical Income Tables based on 
               CPS data (see Figure S11). For purposes of this comparison, we extend our sample to include all 
               individuals aged 25-34 and exclude individuals with no reported individual income. 
                
               C. Copula 
                
               The copula we use is the 100 x 100 percentile transition matrix constructed by Chetty et al. (2014a, 
                                    29
               Online Data Table 1).  We briefly summarize the methodology used to construct this copula below; 
               see Chetty et al. (2014a, Appendix A) for further information.  
                
               Sample Construction  
                
               The sample consists of the set of children in Social Security Administration population records who 
               are born between 1980-1982 and are U.S. citizens as of 2013. For each child, we then define the 
               parent(s) as the first person(s) who claim the child as a dependent on a 1040 tax form. Ninety percent 
               of children born between 1980 and 1982 can be linked to parents based on dependent claiming. We 
               limit the sample to children who can be linked to parents. 
                
               Income Definitions 
                
               We define both parents‚Äô and children‚Äôs family income in the tax data as follows. In years where the 
               individual files a tax return, we define family income as Adjusted Gross Income (as reported on the 
               1040 tax return) plus tax-exempt interest income and the non-taxable portion of Social Security and 
               Disability benefits. In years where the individual does not file a tax return, we define family income 
               as the sum of wage earnings (reported on form W-2), unemployment benefits (reported on form 
               1099-G), and gross social security and disability benefits (reported on form SSA-1099). In years 
               where the individual has no tax return and no information returns, family income is coded as zero. 
                
               We average  parents‚Äô  family  income  over  the  five  years  from  1996  to  2000  (the  earliest  years 
               available in the sample) to obtain a proxy for parent lifetime income that is less affected by transitory 
               fluctuations. We define child family income as mean income over the last two years in the data (2011 
               and 2012), when children in the 1980-82 cohorts are in their early thirties. 
                
               Construction of Copula 
                
               We exclude parents with zero or negative income when constructing the copula because parents with 
               no earnings typically do not file a tax return and hence cannot be linked to their children based on 
               dependent claiming. After excluding parents with zero income, we assign parents percentile ranks 
               based on their incomes relative to other parents in the sample. Children are assigned percentile ranks 
               based on their incomes relative to other children in the same birth cohort. We estimate the copula

                                                              25 
                                                                 
                non-parametrically as a 100√ó100 matrix that gives the joint probability of each child and parent 
                percentile rank pair. 
                 
                For simplicity, we use the same copula when analyzing subgroups (by gender and state). Using 
                gender-specific or state-specific copulas yields very similar estimates of mean absolute mobility by 
                cohort (not reported). We also use the same copula when measuring income at age 40, motivated by 
                evidence that distribution of income ranks is stable between the ages of 30 and 60 (Chetty et al. 
                2014a). 
                 
                D. Constructing Absolute Mobility 
                 
                We combine the copula and the marginal income distributions for each birth cohort to calculate the 
                fraction of children who earn as much or more than their parents at each parental income percentile. 
                The mean absolute mobility for a given cohort is simply the average of the rates of absolute mobility 
                across  all  parental  income  levels.  We  include  parents  with  zero  income  when  computing  these 
                cohort-level averages, noting that children whose parents have zero income always earn at least as 
                much as their parents. Formally, we calculate mean absolute mobility in cohort c as 
                 
                                               A = z  + (1 ‚Äì z )A          ,                             (1) 
                                                 c    c        c  c | Par_Inc >0 
                where z  is the fraction of parents with zero income in cohort c and A             is mean absolute 
                        c                                                              c  |  Par_Inc >0
                mobility for positive parental income (computed as an unweighted mean of absolute mobility across 
                percentiles). 
                 
                E. Variable Definitions for Sensitivity and Heterogeneity Analysis 
                 
                This subsection defines the variables used for the sensitivity and heterogeneity analysis in Section IV 
                of the paper. 
                 
                Alternative Price Deflators 
                 
                We  obtain  additional  deflators  (PCEPI,  PPI,  GDP  Deflator,  CPI-U)  from  the  Federal  Reserve 
                Economic Data (FRED) database from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  
                 
                Taxes and Transfers  
                 
                We estimate taxes using the NBER TAXSIM model (Feenberg et al. 1993). TAXSIM provides 
                federal tax estimates starting in 1960. We use it to estimate federal tax liability after credits for 
                children in all cohorts and for parents in 1960 and thereafter. To estimate taxes for parents prior to 
                1960, we use data on federal marginal tax rates and exemptions from Wilson (2002).  
                 
                We compute taxes in TAXSIM using the following variables: year, marital status, age of the primary 
                and secondary taxpayers, wages and salary income (replicating the definitions in our baseline income 
                specification), and number of dependents. We use the output variable FIITAX, the federal income tax 
                liability after credits. When using marginal tax rates (prior to 1960), we determine exemptions based 
                on marital status and the number of dependents. 
                 
                We use two sources of data to measure transfers. First, we use the CPS and Census to measure the 
                value of cash transfers from welfare programs and Supplemental Security Income. In particular, we 
                                                                26 
                                                                   
               add in the variables incwelfr and incssi in IPUMS-CPS, and incwelfr and incsupp in IPUMS-USA. 
               We are able to measure these transfers for children in all years and for parents from 1970 onward.  
                
               Second, we include estimates of in-kind transfers from Fox et al. (2015), which cover SNAP, WIC, 
               housing assistance, the School Lunch Program, and LIHEAP. Data on in-kind transfers are only 
               available from 1967 onward. Prior to 1967, these transfers are set to zero. Fox et al. (2015) use CPS 
               and administrative data to estimate mean transfers (with and without tax credits) by marital status, 
               number of children, age categories, and family income decile for each year. We use these four 
               criteria  to  bin  our  observations  and  then assign  everyone in each bin the corresponding average 
               transfer amount. Families with positive income are assigned the mean transfer excluding tax credits, 
               and families with incomes of zero or less are assigned mean transfer including tax credits. This is 
               because  families  with  positive  incomes  have  already  had  their  tax-credits  accounted  for  by 
                         30
               TAXSIM.  
                
               Alternative Income Measures 
                
               We use the following alternative income definitions for sensitivity analyses (Figure S6):  
                
               Total family income is defined as the sum of personal incomes of all co-residing members of the 
               same primary family (e.g., siblings, parents, or any other relatives). In our baseline analysis, we use 
               the sum of spouses‚Äô total personal income minus income from welfare after 1950; however, we rely 
               on total family income to measure parents‚Äô income in the 1950 Census as spouses‚Äô total personal 
               income is not reported. The total family income definition is consistent across all years starting with 
               the 1950 Census. 
                
               Wage and salary income is defined as the sum of spouses‚Äô income from wages and salaries. In our 
               baseline  analysis,  we  use  wage  and  salary  income  to  measure  incomes  in  the  1940  Census 
               (supplemented by imputed non-wage, non-salary income) because measures of total family income 
               and spousal income are not available. The wage and salary income measure is consistent across all 
               years starting with the 1940 Census. 
                
               Section II: Additional Robustness Checks 
                
               In this section, we present a set of supplementary robustness checks that address various limitations 
               of the data we use. 
                
               First, our baseline analysis measures parents‚Äô family income as the sum of spouses‚Äô total personal 
               income in the 1960-1980 Censuses. However, the 1950 Census only reports total family income, 
               while  the  1940  Census  includes  only  wages  and  salaries,  forcing  us  to  use  different  income 
               definitions in these earlier  years as discussed above. Figure S6 shows that the trend in absolute 
               mobility is very similar if we use alternative income definitions that do not change across Censuses: 
               the sum of the spouses‚Äô wage and salary income only or total family income, defined as the sum of 
               income earned by all co-residing members of the primary family.  
                
                                                                          
               30 The estimates on credits provided by TAXSIM are frequently higher than Fox et al. (2015), consistent with under-
               reporting of credits in the survey data (Meyer, Mok, and Sullivan 2015). To check whether such under-reporting 
               affects our results, we implement specifications doubling the transfers reported by Fox et al. (2015). Our baseline 
               estimates of absolute mobility are not affected appreciably by such a correction. 
                                                              27 
                                                                
                Second, the CPS data does not record individuals‚Äô birthplace before 1994. As a result, our baseline 
                series excludes immigrants starting with the 1964 cohort. To verify that this change in the treatment 
                of  immigrants  does  not  affect  our  results,  Figure  S7  includes  immigrants  in  the  calculation  of 
                children‚Äôs marginal income distributions for all cohorts. Absolute mobility is slightly lower when 
                immigrants are included because immigrants tend to have lower earnings than natives on average, but 
                the trends are similar to our baseline results. 
                 
                Third, in our baseline analysis, we pool data across multiple Censuses to measure the incomes of all 
                parents between the ages of 25 and 35. This procedure provides an imperfect measure of parents‚Äô 
                incomes because it relies on the assumption that the income distribution of those who have children 
                after age 35 is representative of the income distribution of the general population and because it does 
                not  account  for  mortality  or  changes  in  parents‚Äô  marital  status  across  Censuses.  To  assess  the 
                robustness of our findings to these concerns, we replicate our analysis using only a single Census to 
                measure parents‚Äô incomes, restricting parents‚Äô age at childbirth to be between 25 and 35. Figure S8 
                shows that we obtain very similar results when we focus on this subsample of parents. 
                 
                Finally, the baseline results combine data for parents from the Census with data from the CPS for 
                children. The use of the CPS for children permits measurement of children‚Äôs income in each birth 
                cohort at exactly age 30, while the use of the Census for parents allows us to obtain data on parents‚Äô 
                incomes back to 1940 (as the CPS began collecting comprehensive income data only in 1967). To 
                ensure  that  mixing  income  information  from  two  different  datasets  does  not  produce  bias,  we 
                estimate marginal income distributions using either the Census or the CPS for  both parents and 
                children. Figure S9 shows that we obtain very similar estimates of absolute mobility when we use 
                data from only the Census or only the CPS for both parents and children for the cohorts where data 
                             31
                are available.  
                 
                 
                Section III: Counterfactuals 
                 
                This  section  provides  further  detail  on  the  methodology  used  to  construct  the  counterfactuals 
                discussed in Section V of the text and presents an additional set of counterfactuals to assess  the 
                robustness of our conclusions. 
                 
                A. Methods for Baseline Counterfactuals 
                 
                Higher GDP Growth Scenario 
                 
                To  construct  the  higher  growth  counterfactual,  we  first  calculate  the  ratio  of  income  at  each 
                percentile q of the income distribution at age 30 for children in the 1980 birth cohort (Ì±¶Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µ     ) to 
                                                           Ì±ÇÌ†µ                   Ì±ÇÌ†µ                          Ì±ûÌ†µ,1980
                GDP per working-age family in 2010 (Ì∞∫Ì†µ        ). We measure Ì∞∫Ì†µ       using annualized real GDP data 
                                                          2010                  2010
                from  FRED  (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPCA).  The  number  of  working-age  families  is 
                                                                           
                31 For simplicity, when we measure parents‚Äô incomes in the CPS, we only include parents between the ages of 25 
                and 35 who have a child less than one year old at the time of the survey. Unlike in our baseline analysis, we do not 
                pool earlier or later surveys to include parents who have children before age 25 or after age 35 when estimating 
                parents‚Äô incomes using the CPS. This is why the levels of absolute mobility in this series are closer to those in 
                Figure S8, which shows comparable estimates from our baseline Census-CPS specification. When we estimate 
                children‚Äôs incomes using the Census, we include individuals born in the U.S. who are 30 years old. 
                 
                                                                  28 
                                                                    
                     calculated by summing the household weights of all ‚Äúfamunits‚Äù that contain at least one person aged 
                     18-64 in the Census, excluding those living in group quarters (GQ = 3 or 4). 
                                                                                                                     Ì∞∂Ì†µ
                     We then compute counterfactual GDP per working-age family in 2010 (Ì∞∫Ì†µ                                ) by applying 30 years 
                                                                                                                     2010
                     of  a  2.5%  annual  growth  to  the  1980  GDP  per  working-age  family  of  $87,908.  This  gives  a 
                                                                      Ì∞∂Ì†µ                                         30
                     counterfactual GDP per family of  Ì∞∫Ì†µ                   =$184,393= $87,908√ó1.025  in 2010, compared to the 
                                               Ì±ÇÌ†µ                     2010
                     observed value of Ì∞∫Ì†µ           = $136,198. Finally we create the counterfactual incomes by multiplying the 
                                              2010               Ì±òÌ†µ            Ì±òÌ†µ        Ì±ÇÌ†µ                                           Ì∞∂Ì†µ
                     observed income-to-GDP ratios (ÌºãÌ†µ                   =Ì±¶Ì†µ         /Ì∞∫Ì†µ      ) by the counterfactual GDP Ì∞∫Ì†µ               .  
                                                                 Ì±ûÌ†µ,1980      Ì±ûÌ†µ,1980    2010                                        2010
                     We use analogous methods to calculate absolute mobility under the alternative annual growth rates of 
                     1-10% presented in Figure 5B.  
                      
                     More Broadly Shared Growth Scenario 
                      
                     To construct the more broadly shared growth counterfactual, we first calculate the ratio of income 
                     at each percentile of the income distribution at age 30 for children in the 1940 birth cohort (Ì±¶Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µ                              ) 
                                                                              Ì±ÇÌ†µ                                                               Ì±ûÌ†µ,1940
                     to GDP per working-age family in 1970 (Ì∞∫Ì†µ                     ). We then multiply this ratio by the observed 2010

                     B. Robustness to Alternative Counterfactuals 
                      
                     Measuring Income at Older Ages 
                      
                     Our more broadly shared growth counterfactual reallocates income not just across different income 
                     groups  but  also  across  individuals  of  different  ages.  In  this  subsection,  we  assess  whether  this 
                     reallocation across ages affects our conclusion that a broader distribution of growth across income 
                     groups would substantially increase absolute mobility. 
                      
                     To motivate the issue, note that by using the ratio of child incomes at age 30 to GDP per working-age 
                     family to characterize the income distribution, our counterfactuals combine three channels through 
                     which the allocation of GDP affects children‚Äôs marginal income distributions. First, within the set of 
                     30 year olds in our sample, the allocation of income has become more unequal over time. In 1970, 
                     the difference between the 90th and 10th percentile of the income distribution of 30 year olds was 
                     $70,011; this difference grew to $118,347 in 2010. Second, the total amount of GDP per working-age 
                     family that accrues to 30 year olds has declined. The average income of 30 year olds in our sample 
                     fell from 69% of GDP per working-age family in 1970 to 44% in 2010. Finally, the total amount of 
                     national income captured in the CPS and Census has declined with the rise of profits and the increase 
                     in top income shares, which are not fully recorded in surveys (Bollinger et al. 2015, Piketty, Saez, 
                     Zucman 2016). The ratio of total income in the CPS to total GDP declined from 73% in 1970 to 60% 
                     in 2010. 
                      
                     To understand the contributions of these three components to our counterfactuals under the broadly 
                     shared growth scenario, we first consider a counterfactual that uses the total income in the CPS (per 
                     working-age family) instead of GDP to measure Ì∞∫Ì†µÌ±ÇÌ†µ                      . This lowers the estimated rate of absolute 
                                                                                        2010
                     mobility from the baseline value of 80% to 72%. As expected, a broadly shared growth scenario that 
                     does not fully account for the rise of incomes not captured in the CPS generates a lower rate of 
                     absolute upward mobility. 
                                                                                    29 
                                                                                       
                                                                          Ì±ÇÌ†µ
                Second, we consider a counterfactual that replaces GDP (Ì∞∫Ì†µ    ) with the total amount of income that 
                                                                          2010
                accrues to 30 year olds in the CPS. In this scenario, absolute mobility would be 57%. This result 
                shows that a significant portion of the increase in absolute mobility in our baseline more broadly 
                shared growth counterfactual is driven by the fact that 30 year olds today earn a smaller fraction of 
                GDP than in the past. This finding raises the potential concern that the effects of distributing income 
                more equally on absolute mobility might differ if we measure incomes at older ages. 
                 
                We evaluate this concern by repeating our counterfactuals, measuring incomes at age 40 instead of 
                age 30. We construct counterfactuals for the 1970 cohort, the most recent decadal birth cohort for 
                whom  we  can  measure  income  at  age  40.  For  the  higher  growth  scenario,  we  use  the  same 
                counterfactual level of GDP per working-age family in 2010 used for the age 30 counterfactuals, 
                 Ì∞∂Ì†µ               32
                Ì∞∫Ì†µ    =$184,393.  However, we multiply the observed income-to-GDP ratios for 40 year olds in 
                 2010   Ì±òÌ†µ        Ì±òÌ†µ      Ì±ÇÌ†µ         Ì∞∂Ì†µ
                2010 (ÌºãÌ†µ      =Ì±¶Ì†µ      /Ì∞∫Ì†µ    ) by Ì∞∫Ì†µ     to create the counterfactual income distribution at age 40 
                        Ì±ûÌ†µ,1970   Ì±ûÌ†µ,1970 2010      2010
                for the 1970 cohort under higher GDP growth. For the more broadly shared growth scenario, we 
                calculate income-to-GDP ratios using incomes and GDP in 1980, when the 1940 cohort was 40 years 
                old. We then multiply these ratios by observed GDP per working-age family in 2010 (Ì∞∫Ì†µÌ±ÇÌ†µ        )  to 
                                                                                                           2010
                construct estimates of what the 1970 cohort would have earned at age 40 if GDP in 2010 were 
                allocated more evenly. 
                 
                Panel A of Figure S12 presents the results of these counterfactuals, along with the actual levels of 
                absolute mobility observed at age 40 for the 1940 and 1970 birth cohorts. In the data, mean absolute 
                mobility at age 40 fell from 86% for the 1940 cohort to 56% for the 1970 cohort. Our counterfactual 
                analysis shows that mean absolute mobility for the 1970 cohort would be 68% under the higher 
                growth counterfactual, closing 39% of the gap between the two cohorts. Mean absolute mobility 
                would rise to 74% for the 1970 cohort under the more broadly shared growth counterfactual, closing 
                59% of the observed gap between the two cohorts. Hence, the qualitative conclusion that more 
                broadly  shared  growth  would  have  a  substantial  effect  on  absolute  mobility  is  unaffected  by 
                measuring income at later ages. Intuitively, the effect of the changing age distribution of growth 
                noted above is partly offset by the greater degree of inequality in incomes at older ages, which 
                increases the impact of changing the income distribution. 
                 
                Using Shares of GDP Growth Instead of Levels 
                 
                In  our  baseline  analysis,  we  construct  counterfactual  incomes  by  allocating  GDP  based  on 
                individuals‚Äô observed shares of the level of GDP at age 30. An equally reasonable alternative is to 
                construct counterfactuals based on individuals‚Äô observed shares of GDP growth from birth to age 30. 
                In this subsection, we assess whether using growth shares would affect our conclusions. 
                 
                To construct counterfactual incomes under the higher growth scenario using growth shares, we first 
                calculate the difference in income between children and parents at each percentile q for the 1980 
                cohort (Ì±¶Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µ   ‚àíÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µ    ). We then calculate the change in GDP per working-age family from 1980 
                         Ì±ûÌ†µ,1980   Ì±ûÌ†µ,1980
                to 2010 (Ì∞∫Ì†µÌ±ÇÌ†µ  ‚àíÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ÇÌ†µ   ). Dividing the difference in income at a given percentile by the change in 
                           2010    1980
                GDP gives us the ratio of income to GDP growth at each percentile for the 1980 cohort. We then 
                                                                           
                32 We use the same counterfactual GDP ‚Äì applying 30 years of a 2.5% annual growth rate to GDP in 1980 ‚Äì even 
                though children are 40 years old when we measure their incomes because children‚Äôs incomes are still measured 
                approximately 30 years after their parents‚Äô incomes. 
                                                                30 
                                                                   
               multiply these ratios by the counterfactual GDP per family growth of $96,485 ‚Äì the counterfactual 
               GDP per working-age family of Ì∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µ    =$184,393 minus observed 1980 GDP of $87,908 ‚Äì and add 
                                                2010
               them to the 1980 parent incomes at each percentile to obtain counterfactual incomes for children.  
                
               To construct counterfactual incomes under the more broadly shared growth scenario using growth 
               shares, we first calculate the difference in parent versus child incomes at each percentile of the 
               income distribution for the 1940 cohort (Ì±¶Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µ  ‚àíÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µ    ). We then divide these differences by the 
                                                        Ì±ûÌ†µ,1940   Ì±ûÌ†µ,1940     Ì±ÇÌ†µ      Ì±ÇÌ†µ
               increase in GDP per working-age family from 1940 to 1970 (Ì∞∫Ì†µ       ‚àíÌ∞∫Ì†µ     ) to obtain the ratio of 
                                                                              1970    1940
               income to GDP growth at each percentile for the 1940 cohort. We then multiply these ratios by the 
               observed change in GDP per working-age family from 1980-2010 of $48,291 ($136,198 in 2010 
               minus $87,908 in 1980) and add them to the 1980 parent incomes at each percentile to obtain 
               counterfactual incomes for children.  
                
               The results of this alternative approach are presented in Panel B of Figure S12. We find an even 
               larger impact of the broadly shared growth counterfactual relative to the high growth counterfactual 
               than in our baseline counterfactuals. Under the broadly shared growth counterfactual, mean absolute 
               mobility rises to 80%; under the higher growth counterfactual, mean absolute mobility falls to 47%. 
               This is because many percentiles of the children‚Äôs income distribution have fallen relative to their 
               parents for the 1980 birth cohort. For these groups, allocating growth in accord with how it has 
               been allocated between 1980-2010 (i.e., using negative growth shares) decreases their incomes 
               further. Conversely, changing the distribution to the more equal shares of growth experienced by the 
               1940 cohort has very large effects. 
                
               In Panel C of Figure S12, we replicate the growth shares counterfactuals in Panel B, measuring 
               incomes at age 40 for the 1970 cohort. These counterfactuals are constructed in the same way as 
               above, except that they use income growth to GDP growth ratios for the years 1950-1980 rather than 
               1940-1970 in the more broadly shared growth counterfactual. The results at age 40 are very similar 
               to those at age 30. 
                
               In  sum,  these  alternative  counterfactuals  reinforce  the  conclusion  that  higher  GDP  growth  itself 
               cannot increase absolute mobility unless it is more broadly distributed.

                               Notes: This figure plots the fraction of children earning more than their parents (‚Äúabsolute 
                               mobility‚Äù)  by  parental  income  percentile  for  selected  child  birth  cohorts  (Panel  A)  and  on 
                               average by child birth cohort (Panel B). Panel A includes only parents with positive income; 
                               within  this  group,  parents‚Äô  income  percentiles  are  constructed  based  on  their  ranks  in  the 
                               distribution  of  parents‚Äô  incomes  within  each  child  cohort.  Panel  B  includes  parents  with  0 
                               income, defining absolute mobility as 100% for that subgroup when computing the mean rate of 
                               absolute mobility by cohort. Children‚Äôs income is measured at age 30 in the CPS-ASEC as the 
                               sum of individual and spousal income, excluding immigrants after 1994. Parental income is 
                               measured in the Census as the sum of the spouses‚Äô incomes for families in which the highest 
                               earner is between age 25-35. Children‚Äôs and parents‚Äô incomes are measured in real 2014 dollars 
                               using the CPI-U-RS. Absolute mobility is calculated by combining these income distributions 
                               with  the  copula  estimated  for  the  1980-82  cohorts  in  tax  data  by  Chetty  et  al.  (2014a)

        Notes: These figures show how the copula affects estimates of absolute mobility by birth cohort. Panel A plots bounds on absolute mobility for each 
        cohort over all copulas satisfying first-order stochastic dominance of children‚Äôs income distributions as parent income rises. The bounds are estimated 
        separately by cohort. The solid circles in Panel A replicate the baseline estimates shown in Figure 1B, with the section to the right of the dashed vertical 
        line corresponding to the cohorts (1971-1984) for which Chetty et al. (2014b) document copula stability. Panel B plots the marginal family income 
        distributions of children in the 1940 birth cohort and their parents, measured at approximately age 30. Corresponding to the analysis in Figure 1A, parents 
        with zero income are excluded, but children with zero income are included when estimating these kernel densities. For scaling purposes, incomes above 
        $200,000 are excluded. Panel C plots analogous income distributions for children in the 1980 birth cohort and their parents. Panel D plots the income 
        percentile that a child must reach in order to earn more than his or her parents for the 1940 and 1980 cohorts, with labels corresponding to the examples 
        shown by the dashed vertical lines in Panels B and C. Panel D also shows a heat map of the baseline copula for the 1980-82 birth cohorts. The copula is a 
        100x100 matrix where each cell (x,y) gives the probability of a child being in income percentile y and having parents in income percentile x (conditional 
        on parents having positive income). Darker colors represent areas with higher density in the copula.

            Notes: This figure plots absolute mobility by child birth cohort  using a set of alternative income definitions. Panel A presents estimates that use 
            alternative price deflators to adjust for inflation, including the producer price index (PPI) and the personal consumption expenditure price index (PCEPI). 
            We also consider a price index that adjusts for bias in the CPI-U-RS due to new and higher quality products by subtracting 0.8% from the annual 
            inflation rate implied by the CPI-U-RS (Meyer & Sullivan 2009, Broda and Weinstein 2010). Panel B presents estimates using income after including 
            federal taxes and transfers. Taxes are estimated using the NBER TAXSIM model (Feenberg 1993) for years after 1960, and historical marginal tax rates 
            before 1960. Transfers include cash and in-kind transfers. Cash transfers are obtained from Census and CPS data. In-kind transfers are obtained from 
            calculations by Fox et al. (2015) using CPS data from calendar year 1967 onward; prior to 1967, in-kind transfers are set to zero. Panel C plots absolute 
            mobility when children‚Äôs income is measured at age 40 and parental income is measured between ages 35-45. Note that the last year of income data in 
            our sample is 2014, so absolute mobility can only be measured at age 40 until the 1974 birth cohort. Panel D presents estimates that adjust income for 
            family size and number of earners. In the series in open circles, we divide the baseline measures of family income by the square root of family size 
            (defined as the number of dependent children plus the number of adults) for both parents and children. In the series in triangles, we estimate the fraction 
            of sons whose individual incomes are greater than or equal to their fathers‚Äô individual incomes. Individual income is defined in the same way as the 
            baseline family income measure, but does not include spousal income.

                                  Notes: This figure shows trends in absolute mobility by state. Panel A shows estimates for decadal 
                                  birth cohorts for selected states; data by cohort for all other states is reported in Table S2. Panel B 
                                  shows a heat map of the magnitude of the decline in absolute mobility from the 1940 to 1980 
                                  cohorts, with darker colors representing states with larger declines. For parents, state refers to 
                                  location at the time incomes are measured (between ages 25-35); for children, state refers to 
                                  location at birth. Since children‚Äôs state of birth is not observed in the CPS, we use the Census for 
                                  both parents and children. To increase precision, we include all children aged 25-35 and use the 
                                  100% Census in 1940 and 5% IPUMS sample in 1980. Measuring children‚Äôs incomes from ages 
                                  25-35 rather than just at age 30 creates small differences in levels of absolute mobility. To adjust 
                                  for  these  differences,  we  calculate  the  difference  between  the  baseline  national  estimates  and 
                                  population-weighted national means of our state-level estimates for each cohort, and add these 
                                  differences to the state-level estimates.

                       Notes: This figure shows how absolute mobility for the 1980 cohort would change under counterfactual 
                       scenarios varying GDP growth rates or the distribution of income. Panel A plots absolute mobility by parent 
                       income percentile. The solid curves replicate the baseline estimates of observed absolute mobility by parent 
                       income percentile from Figure 1A for the 1940 and 1980 birth cohorts. The dashed series, ‚Äú1940 GDP/family 
                       growth rate (2.5%), 1980 income shares,‚Äù plots the rates of absolute mobility that the 1980 cohort would have 
                       experienced had GDP per working-age family grown at 2.5% annually from 1980-2010 instead of the actual 
                       rate of 1.5%. The resulting higher level of GDP in 2010 is allocated to households based on the ratio of 
                       income to GDP per working family at each percentile of the family income distribution for 30 year olds in 
                       2010.  The  dotted  series,  ‚Äú1980 GDP/family  growth rate (1.5%), 1940 income shares‚Äù plots the rates of 
                       absolute mobility that the 1980 cohort would have experienced had GDP in 2010 been allocated in the same 
                       manner across households as it was for the 1940 cohort. In this counterfactual, GDP remains at the observed 
                       level in 2010, but income is allocated to households based on the ratio of income to GDP per working family 
                       at each percentile in the 1940 cohort. For each series, we also report the mean level of absolute mobility 
                       (AM),  averaging  across  all  income  percentiles  (including  parents  with  zero  incomes,  whose  children 
                       mechanically have absolute mobility of 100% and are not shown in the figure). In Panel B, the solid line plots 
                       mean absolute  mobility  for  the  1980  cohort  had  they  experienced  alternative  GDP  growth  rates.  These 
                       estimates are constructed in the same way as the estimate of AM for the ‚Äú1940 GDP/family growth rate 
                       (2.5%), 1980 income shares‚Äù series in Panel A, using growth rates ranging from 1% to 10%. The dashed 
                       horizontal lines show the actual levels of AM for the 1940 and 1980 birth cohorts. See Section III of the 
                       Supplementary Appendix for further details on these counterfactuals.

         Notes: This figure depicts the copulas that generate the bounds on absolute mobility for the 1980 cohort in Figure 2A. Panel A 
         presents the copula that generates the upper bound on absolute mobility, while Panel B presents the copula that generates the 
         lower bound on absolute mobility. Darker shades represent cells with greater mass in the copula. The solid curve in both panels 
         shows the rank that a child must reach in order to surpass the income of their parents by parental income percentile in the 1980 
         birth cohort, as in Figure 2D.

         divide the baseline family income measures for both parents and children by either the total number of adults in the household 
         (triangles) or by family size (open circles). The number of adults is defined as one plus an indicator for being married. In the 
         CPS, family size is defined as the number of own children plus the number of spouses. In the Census, family size is defined as 
         the number of own family members residing with each individual.

         fraction of children earning 20% more than their parents or 20% less than their parents. Panel B plots the median ratio of child to 
         parent income. All other aspects of the absolute mobility calculations are identical to those used in the baseline specification.

         Notes: This figure plots absolute mobility by cohort, replicating Figure 1B using alternative income definitions for parents and 
         children. Wage Income is computed as the sum of wage and salary income of the individual and spouse (if applicable). Family 
         income is total income from all co-residing members of the primary family. The Supplemental Appendix provides further details 
         on how these measures are defined. Aside from these changes to the income definition, all other aspects of the specification are 
         identical to the baseline.

         Notes: This figure plots absolute mobility by cohort, replicating Figure 1B including immigrants in the sample of children. The 
         CPS-ASEC did not collect data on birthplace prior to 1994, so the 1964 cohort is the first cohort for which immigrants are 
         excluded from our baseline sample.

         Notes: This figure replicates Figure 1B after restricting the sample to parents who have a child between ages 25-35, the ages at 
         which we measure parents‚Äô incomes. All other aspects of the specification are identical to the baseline. The baseline estimates 
         include all parents who have a child between ages 16-45 by pooling data across multiple Censuses.

         Notes: This figure plots absolute mobility by cohort, measuring both parents‚Äô and children‚Äôs incomes using the same dataset 
         rather than using annual CPS data for children and decadal Census data for parents as in our baseline specification. In the Census 
         only series, parents‚Äô incomes are identical to the baseline, while children‚Äôs income distributions are defined using total family 
         income among all 30-year olds. In the CPS only series, children‚Äôs incomes are identical to the baseline, while parents‚Äô income 
         distributions are calculated using total family income for parents of newborns in families where the higher-earning parent is aged 
         25-35. The CPS only series therefore excludes parents who have children after age 35 or before age 25, as in Figure S8. The CPS 
         only series begins in 1968 because consistent income definitions for parents are not readily available in prior years. All other 
         aspects of the specifications in both series are identical to the baseline.

         (including spousal income). The series in solid triangles plots the fraction of sons whose family income exceeds their parents‚Äô 
         family income, replicating Figure 1B for sons. Similarly, the series in hollow triangles plots the fraction of daughters whose 
         family income exceeds their parents‚Äô family income. The series in circles plots the fraction of sons whose individual income 
         exceeds their fathers‚Äô individual income, replicating the series in Figure 3D. The series in squares plots the fraction of daughters 
         whose individual income exceeds their fathers‚Äô individual income.

         (individual) income, adjusting for inflation using CPI-U-RS. In contrast to our baseline marginal income distributions, we pool 
         individuals from ages 25-34 and drop individuals with zero income for comparability with the published Census tables.

               Notes: This figure presents the alternative counterfactual scenarios described in Section III of the Supplemental Appendix. Panel A replicates the 
               counterfactuals in Figure 5A, measuring incomes at age 40 instead of age 30. We use the 1970 cohort instead of the 1980 cohort for the age 40 analyses 
               as it is the most recent decadal cohort for which income at age 40 can be observed. Panel B reports results from GDP growth shares counterfactuals, in 
               which counterfactual incomes for children in the 1980 cohort are constructed based on observed shares of GDP growth from birth to age 30 (1980-
               2010) rather than shares of GDP levels in 2010. Panel C replicates Panel B, measuring incomes at age 40 instead of age 30. In all panels, the dotted 
               lines present the higher GDP growth counterfactuals, while the dashed lines present the more equal growth counterfactuals.

                                       Notes: The table presents summary statistics for the samples used to estimate parents' and children's
                                       marginal income distributions in our baseline analysis. Columns 1-4 report statistics for children from the
                                       CPS, while columns 5-7 report statistics for parents from the Census. Column 1 reports the total number of 
                                       children observed at age 30 in each birth cohort in the CPS; for example, the 1940 cohort is observed at
                                       age 30 in the 1970 CPS. Column 2 reports the sum of the sampling weights for each birth cohort in the
                                       CPS, i.e. the weighted cohort size. Columns 3 and 4 report the mean and median incomes of these
                                       children at age 30 using our baseline family income measure, which sums income across spouses.
                                       Column 5 presents the number of families who have children in each birth cohort, drawing on data from
                                       multiple Census years as described in the text. Columns 6 and 7 present the mean and median family
                                       incomes of these parents. Incomes are expressed in 2014 dollars, adjusting for inflation using the CPI-U-
                                       RS.

                        Notes: This table presents rates of absolute mobility by state for decadal cohorts from 1940-80; the final column shows the
                        magnitude of the change from 1940 to 1980. Since children‚Äôs state of birth is not observed in the CPS, we use the Census for
                        both parents and children. To increase precision, we include all children aged 25-35 and use the 100% Census in 1940 and 5%
                        IPUMS sample in 1980. Measuring children‚Äôs incomes from ages 25-35 rather than just at age 30 creates small differences in
                        levels of absolute mobility. To adjust for these differences, we calculate the difference between the baseline national estimates
                        and population-weighted national means of our state-level estimates for each cohort, and add these differences to the state-
                        level estimates. State-cohort cells with insufficient data are blank.
