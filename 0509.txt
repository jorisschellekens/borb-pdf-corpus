          Game Board Novel Project 
        
               NO LATE PROJECTS OR LATE PASSES ALLOWED! 
        
       For your novel project you will create a game board that also contains game pieces, trivia cards, 
       and instructions. I should have a good understanding of the novel’s plot, characters, setting, 
       theme, and conflict from your game.  
        
       Steps for creating your game board: 
        1.  Draw the map of spaces on a poster board. It could be circular, like the board in 
          Monopoly, or one-way, like the board in Candy Land. It will help to consider the story 
          you are basing the game board on and what locations are significant to the novel. Does 
          the story start and end in the same place, or does the main character start in one location 
          and end in another? The game board should accurately reflect the story of the book. 
        
        2.  Color the poster board with illustrations and designs to reflect the locations from the book 
          represented in the game. Additionally, consider the setting. The game board should be 
          designed to reflect the setting. So if they are stranded on an island, the board itself should 
          be an island. If the main character visits a cave filled with dragons around the middle of 
          the book, the area of the board around the middle might be decorated with dragons. 
        
        3.  Write instructions on some of the spaces to introduce variety to the game and tie in to 
          events from the plot of your novel. Some spaces can have instructions to move forward or 
          backward a number of spaces, sit out a turn, roll the dice an extra time, or other 
          instructions that may relate to good/bad events from the story. Look to other board games 
          for inspiration. 
        
        4.  Write a minimum of 20 trivia questions on note cards with rewards like an extra turn or 
          moving forward extra spaces if they answer the question correctly, or losing a turn or 
          moving back spaces if they are incorrect. Write instructions on some of the board game 
          spaces to draw a trivia card. This demonstrates, more importantly, an understanding of 
          the material in the book. Write questions regarding characters, setting, conflict, theme, 
          and plot that only someone who has read the book could answer. 
           
        5.  Include game play instructions so players can easily and clearly understand how to play 
          the game.
