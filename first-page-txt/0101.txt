                                 Abstract
            We describe a protocol that facilitates low friction peer-to-peer exchange of ERC20 tokens on the
            Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is intended to serve as an open standard and common building
            block, driving interoperability among decentralized applications (dApps) that incorporate exchange
            functionality. Trades are executed by a system of Ethereum smart contracts that are publicly acces-
            sible, free to use and that any dApp can hook into. DApps built on top of the protocol can access
            public liquidity pools or create their own liquidity pool and charge transaction fees on the resulting
            volume. The protocol is unopinionated: it does not impose costs on its users or arbitrarily extract
            value from one group of users to beneﬁt another. Decentralized governance is used to continuously
            and securely integrate updates into the base protocol without disrupting dApps or end users.
