          41    Abstract 
          42    Exercise capacity is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial 
          43    respiratory capacity, its biggest contributor, adapts robustly to changes in energy demands 
          44    induced by contractile activity. While transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial enzymes has 
          45    been extensively studied, there is limited information on how mitochondrial membrane lipids are 
          46    regulated. Herein, we show that exercise training or muscle disuse alters mitochondrial 
          47    membrane phospholipids including phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Addition of PE promoted, 
          48    whereas removal of PE diminished, mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Surprisingly, skeletal 
          49    muscle-specific inhibition of mitochondrial-autonomous synthesis of PE caused a respiratory 
          50    failure due to metabolic insults in the diaphragm muscle. While mitochondrial PE deficiency 
          51    coincided with increased oxidative stress, neutralization of the latter did not rescue lethality. 
          52    These findings highlight the previously underappreciated role of mitochondrial membrane 
          53    phospholipids in dynamically controlling skeletal muscle energetics and function.

         56    Introduction 
         57    Low aerobic capacity is a stronger risk factor for all-cause mortality compared to other common 
                                                                                1
         58    risk factors such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and smoking.  Skeletal muscle mitochondrial 
                                                                                     2
         59    respiration is the largest contributor for whole-body aerobic capacity,  which in turn is influenced 
         60    by mitochondrial density and activities of the electron transport system (ETS). Changes in 
         61    physical activity robustly alters skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and maximal aerobic 
                        3,4
         62    capacity.   Such proliferation or diminishment of mitochondrial biomass must coincide with 
         63    synthesis or degradation of mitochondrial enzymes and structural lipids. While processes that 
                                                                   5,6
         64    regulate mitochondrial enzymes are well described,  it is unknown how composition of 
         65    mitochondrial lipids change in response to these adaptations. 
         66     
         67    Lipids of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) are largely phospholipids with only trace 
                                                         7
         68    amounts of sphingolipids and cholesterol.  They consist of phosphatidylcholine (PC, 38-45%), 
         69    phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 32-39%), cardiolipin (CL, 14-23%), phosphatidylinositol (PI, 2-
         70    7%), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lyso-
                                     8
         71    PC, all less than 3%).  These phospholipids not only give rise to the shape of IMM but are also 
                                                              8,9
         72    essential for activities of the enzymes of ETS.   In particular, PE and CL are conical-shaped 
         73    phospholipids that promote the formation of cristae where ETS enzymes reside. These non-
         74    bilayer lipids lessen torsional strain of the IMM by localizing into the negatively curved inner 
         75    leaflet.10 They also bind with high affinity to mitochondrial respiratory complexes and regulate 
         76    their functions.8,11 Human mutations that promote loss of mitochondrial PE or CL are detrimental 
         77    to health.12-14 
         78     
         79    In this study, we set out to describe changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial phospholipidome 
         80    that occurs with exercise or disuse. Mitochondrial PE emerged as a key lipid signature that was 
         81    induced by alterations in physical activity. We then pursued the cellular consequences of

         82   changes in muscle mitochondrial PE per se in skeletal muscle-specific tamoxifen-inducible gain- 
         83   or loss-of-function mouse models. Greater mitochondrial PE, in the absence of changes in the 
         84   abundance of ETS enzymes, was sufficient to increase the capacity for oxidative 
         85   phosphorylation. Loss of mitochondrial PE proved fatal due to metabolic and contractile failure 
         86   in the diaphragm muscle.

         91   in mitochondrial phospholipid composition.  C57BL6/J mice were subject to 5-wk of graded 
         92   treadmill training which promoted skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis (Supplement Figure 
         93   1A). Phospholipid analyses of these mitochondria revealed a disproportionately greater increase 
         94   in PE compared to other phospholipids (Figure 1A&B). High-capacity running (HCR) rats, which 
         95   had been selectively bred for their intrinsic exercise capacity, demonstrate protection from a 
         96   wide range of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases compared to low-capacity running (LCR) 
         97   rats.15 Skeletal muscle mitochondria from HCR rats contained more PE than did LCR 
         98   (Supplement Figure 1B). These observations led us to examine the possibility that an increase 
         99   in mitochondrial PE contributes to increased aerobic capacity in exercise-trained mice or HCR 
        100   rats. 
        101    
        102   Mitochondrial PE is synthesized primarily by the enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 
        103   (PSD) that resides in the IMM.16,17 Skeletal muscle PSD expression was greater in exercise-
        104   trained mice compared to sedentary mice (Figure 1C) and in HCR rats compared to that in LCR 
        105   rats.18 Overexpression of PSD in murine C2C12 myotubes increased the maximal O

        108    PE in vivo, we generated mice with tamoxifen-inducible skeletal-muscle specific overexpression 
        109    of PSD (PSD-MKI) (Figure 1D). This strategy successfully yielded mice with skeletal muscle-
        110    specific PSD overexpression (Figure 1E) and elevated mitochondrial PE (Figure 1F). High-
        111    resolution respirometry/fluorometry experiments revealed that PSD overexpression increased 
        112    the rates of O  consumption and ATP production (Figure 1G&H), effects that were not due to 
                             2
        113    increased mitochondrial mass, abundance of ETS enzymes (Figure 1I, Supplement Figure 1D), 
        114    or fiber-type (Figure 1J). However, the increase in respiratory capacity did not increase treadmill 
        115    endurance performance (Figure 1K) or skeletal muscle force generating capacity ex vivo (Figure 
        116    1L, Supplement Figure 1E&F). PSD-MKI and control mice also did not differ in body weight or 
        117    composition, food intake, or energy expenditure (Supplement Figure 1G-K). Thus, an increase 
        118    in muscle mitochondrial PE can increase oxidative capacity but not to an extent that influences 
        119    endurance. An increase in muscle endurance likely requires concomitant improvements in 
        120    contractile elements and substrate mobilization. 
        121     
        122    Skeletal muscle disuse rapidly reduces mitochondrial mass and function. Reduced 
                                                                                19
        123    mitochondrial function precedes disuse-induced muscle atrophy  and might contribute to the 
        124    mechanism for skeletal muscle loss.20 We subjected C57BL6/J mice to a 2-wk hindlimb 
        125    unloading21 which promoted robust muscle loss (Figure 2A). Phospholipid analyses of skeletal 
        126    muscle mitochondria revealed that disuse promotes an accelerated loss of PE (Figure 2B), 
        127    concomitant with reduced PSD mRNA (Figure 2C). To model the loss of mitochondrial PE in 
        128    vitro, we performed lentivirus-mediated knockdown of PSD in C2C12 myotubes (Supplement 
        129    Figure 2A). Reduction in mitochondrial PE (Supplement Figure 2B) robustly reduced 
        130    mitochondrial respiratory capacity (Supplement Figure 2C&D) in the absence of changes in ETS 
        131    enzymes (Supplement Figure 2E&F), suggesting that lack of PE suppresses activities of 
        132    membrane-bound ETS enzymes (Supplement Figure 2G&H). Since global knockout of PSD is 
        133    embryonically lethal,22 we generated mice with tamoxifen-inducible skeletal muscle-specific

        134    knockout of PSD (PSD-MKO) (Figure 2D&E). Skeletal muscle mitochondria from PSD-MKO 
        135    mice were selectively depleted in PE esterified with polyunsaturated fatty acids (Figure 2F&G, 
        136    Supplement Figure 2I&J). Strikingly, tamoxifen-induced KO promoted a rapid weight loss 
        137    (Figure 2H), kyphosis (Figure 2I), and ultimately death between 6 and 8-wk after tamoxifen 
        138    injection (Figure 2J). The lethality of PSD knockout was likely induced by ventilatory failure in 
        139    respiratory muscles, a common symptom in mitochondrial diseases,23 as evidenced by reduced 
        140    breathing rate and SpO  (Figure 2K&L). Cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, low bone density, 
                                       2
        141    hypophagia, or hypomobility did not explain the premature death in PSD-MKO mice 
        142    (Supplement Figure 2K-S). Reduction in body weight was manifested in both lean and fat mass 
        143    loss (Supplement Figure 2T) as well as in weights of individual muscles including diaphragm 
        144    (Figure 2M, Supplement Figure 2U). The loss in muscle weights were explained by reduction in 
        145    cross-sectional area of individual muscle fibers (Figure 2N, Supplement Figure 2V&W). The 
        146    diaphragm displayed substantial fibrosis (Figure 2O) and loss of force-generating capacity 
        147    (Figure 2P, Supplement Figure 2X&Y). Thus, acute loss of mitochondrial PE promotes a rapid 
        148    loss of skeletal muscle mass and function that is reminiscent of atrophy found in disuse in limb 
        149    muscles as well as that in respiratory muscles during mechanical ventilation.24

        151    As PSD generates PE for the IMM, the underlying cause of lethal myopathy in PSD-MKO mice 
        152    is also likely due to changes to mitochondria. PSD deletion deformed mitochondria with less 
        153    dense cristae (Figure 3A), similar to findings in PSD-depleted CHO cells25 and global PSD 
        154    knockout mice.22 These changes occurred in the absence of alteration in abundance of proteins 
        155    involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission (Supplement Figure 3A). High-resolution 
        156    respirometry and fluorometry experiments revealed a robust reduction in the rates of O

        161    complexes I-IV, but not V, were lower in muscles from PSD-MKO mice than in control muscles 
        162    (Figure 3E). Oxidative phosphorylation is also dependent upon assembly of respiratory 
        163    supercomplexes,30,31 and PE appears to be essential for this process.25 Indeed, reduction in 
        164    mitochondrial PE essentially eliminated the formation of respiratory supercomplexes (Figure 
        165    3F). Together, these observations suggest that mitochondrial PE deficiency stagnates efficient 
        166    electron transfers in the ETS. In turn, inefficiency in electron transfer is predicted to promote 
        167    electron leakage that causes superoxide production.32,33 Indeed, H O  production was markedly 
                                                                                  2  2
        168    higher in PSD-MKO muscles than in control muscles under various substrate conditions (Figure 
        169    3G, Supplement Figure 3D-F). Elevated oxidative stress also increased reactive lipid aldehydes

        171    and counter-oxidative response proteins (Supplement Figure 3G) in PSD-MKO muscles to a 
        172    greater extent than in control muscles. As oxidative stress has been implicated in skeletal 
        173    muscle atrophy,35,36 we further tested the mechanistic link among mitochondrial PE deficiency, 
        174    oxidative stress, and respiratory failure in PSD-MKO mice.

        182    Supplement Figure 4C), force generating capacity (Figure 4E, Supplement Figure 4D), or 
        183    oxidative capacity (Figure 4F, Supplement Figure 4E). Thus, while mitochondrial PE deficiency 
        184    increases oxidative stress, it is not directly responsible for the contractile and metabolic defects 
        185    in the PSD-MKO mice. This finding was somewhat surprising since oxidative stress is predicted

        186    to activate an array of downstream pathways, many of which overlap with defects observed in 
        187    PSD-MKO mice.35,36 To understand the biological processes in PSD-MKO mice that might 
        188    explain their lethality, we performed deep-sequencing analyses on diaphragms from control, 
        189    PSD-MKO, and mCATxPSD-MKO mice. Transcripts for 6,026 genes were differentially 
        190    expressed between control and PSD-MKO diaphragms, and some of which were rescued with 
        191    mCAT overexpression (Supplement Figure 4F). However, a large majority of differentially-
        192    expressed genes were not rescued with mCAT (Supplement Figure 4G), consistent with our 
        193    observations that deficiency in mitochondrial PE triggers events independent of oxidative stress. 
        194    Among the 68 pathways that were statistically significantly affected between control and PSD-
        195    MKO diaphragms, 45 of them remained altered in mCATxPSD-MKO diaphragms (Figure 4G). 
        196    Of particular interest, PSD deletion activated pathways for proteasome and ubiquitin-mediated 
        197    proteolysis, but not lysosome or apoptosis, suggesting that mitochondrial PE deficiency likely 
        198    promotes muscle atrophy via proteasomal degradation (Figure 4H). Interestingly, PSD deletion 
        199    also induced activation of transcriptional and translational pathways that were not reversed in 
        200    mCATxPSD-MKO diaphragms. As expected, mCAT overexpression suppressed activation of 
        201    antioxidant pathways including glutathione metabolism and peroxisomal genes.

        203    Discussion 
        204    Phospholipid molecules are largely insoluble in the aqueous cytosol and their intracellular 
        205    movements are relatively limited. Thus, the membrane phospholipid composition of different 
        206    organelles is highly distinct, thereby creating a biophysical environment unique to each 
        207    subcellular location. In mitochondria, the high concentration of PE not only promotes membrane 
        208    curvature in the cristae, but is also essential for efficient electron transfer and oxidative

        212    and/or intellectual disability.12,14 Combined with data presented in the current manuscript, these 
        213    findings indicate a critical role that mitochondrial PE plays in health and disease. 
        214     
        215    In skeletal muscle, inhibition of mitochondria-autonomous synthesis of PE via PSD causes 
        216    robust skeletal muscle atrophy and ventilatory failure due to fibrosis and loss of contractility in 
        217    the diaphragm muscle. The underlying cause appears to be due to a system failure of 
        218    mitochondrial circuitry that is evident in reduced activities of complex I-IV, low supercomplex 
        219    formation, and elevated electron leak (Figure 4I). We predict that these defects trigger 
        220    proteosomal degradation pathways that promote muscle atrophy and weakness.  In contrast, 
        221    such a phenotype does not occur when PE synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway on the 
        222    ER is inhibited in skeletal muscle,41,42 suggesting that pools of PE made by PSD and CDP-
        223    ethanolamine pathway are functionally distinct. How select phospholipids (such as PC, PI and 
        224    PA) are transported from ER to mitochondria, but PE is unable to do so is not understood.17,40 
        225    Furthermore, it is known that PE generated by PSD is readily transported from mitochondria to 
        226    ER.43 Thus it remains possible that some of the defects in the PSD-MKO mice are due to a lack 
        227    of PE exported from mitochondria. 
        228     
        229    In conclusion, our findings reveal that alteration in PE composition represents a key adaptive 
        230    response to exercise or disuse in skeletal muscle mitochondria. Gain- or loss-of-function studies 
        231    show that changes in mitochondrial PE modulates oxidative capacity independent of changes in 
        232    abundance of ETS proteins. A deficiency of mitochondrial PE in the diaphragm muscle is 
        233    detrimental to its metabolic and contractile function, leading to ventilatory failure and lethality. 
        234    While these defects were associated with increased oxidative stress, its neutralization with 
        235    mitochondrial-targeted catalase did not prevent any of the dysfunction induced by PSD 
        236    deficiency. These findings also raise a possibility that reduced mitochondrial PE represents a 
        237    mechanism by which disuse promotes the loss of muscle mass and function associated with

        298    Mitochondrial isolation 
        299    Tissues were minced in ice cold MIM buffer (300 mM Sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 
        300    mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4) and gently homogenized with a Teflon pestle. The homogenate was

        302    centrifuged again at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The crude mitochondrial pellet was 
        303    suspended in 15% Percoll (diluted with MIM buffer) and a discontinuous Percoll gradient was 
        304    prepared consisting of 50%, 22%, and 15% Percoll layers. Mitochondria were carefully layered 
        305    on top of the gradient and spun at 22,700 RPM for 10 min at 4°C in an ultracentrifuge (Thermo 
        306    Scientific SureSpin 630 rotor). The purified mitochondrial fraction was collected at the 50% -

        347    washing, high-resolution respiration rates were measured using an OROBOROS Oxygraph-2k. 
        348    The muscle fibers were suspended in Buffer Z with 20 mM creatine and 10 µM blebbistatin to 
        349    inhibit myosin ATPases during respiration measurements. A variety of respiration protocols 
        350    were utilized in permeabilized fibers and isolated mitochondria. For the mixed substrate 
        351    protocol, the chamber was hyperoxygenated to ~300 pmol and started with the addition of 
        352    malate (0.5 mM) followed by sequential additions of pyruvate (5 mM), ADP (2 mM), succinate 
        353    (10 mM), cytochrome c (10 µM), rotenone (5 µM), malonate (5mM), duroquinol (0.25 mM), and 
        354    antimycin A (2 µM). For the fatty acid oxidation protocol, the chamber was not hyperoxygenated 
        355    and the protocol started with the addition of malate (0.5 mM) followed by sequential additions of 
        356    palmitoyl-l-carnitine (50 µM) and ADP (2 mM). For Complex IV mediated respiration, rotenone 
        357    (5 µM), malonate (5mM), and antimycin A (2 µM) were added to inhibit Complexes I-III, after 
        358    which ascorbate (2mM, prevents autooxidation of TMPD), TMPD (0.5 mM), and KCN (20 mM) 
        359    were sequentially added. When respiration experiments were complete, fiber bundles were 
        360    washed in distilled H O to remove salts, then freeze dried in a lyophilizer (Lab-Conco). Dry 
                                    2
        361    weight was measured and respiration rate was expressed relative to fiber weight. When isolated 
        362    mitochondria respiration rates were measured, the respiration rate was normalized to the total 
        363    protein content in the chamber.   
        364            Oxygen consumption rates in C2C12 cells were measured with a Seahorse Flux 
        365    Analyzer XF24 or XFe96 (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA). The cells were plated at 
        366    ~20,000-40,000 cells/well and then differentiated into myotubes. On the day of the experiment, 
        367    medium was switched to XF Assay Medium Modified DMEM (pH = 7.4) containing added 
        368    glucose (10 mM), pyruvate (200 mM), and glutamine (200 mM) for 1 h. Subsequently, basal and 
        369    maximal respiration rates were measured as previously described.46

        403    Isolated mitochondria suspended in MIM were solubilized (0.5-2 mg) in 2% digitonin for 15 min 
        404    on ice and then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and 
        405    placed into a new tube, and protein content was measured. Approximately 25-35 µg of 
        406    mitochondrial protein was suspended in a mix of native PAGE 5% G-250 sample buffer and 1X 
        407    native-PAGE sample buffer (total volume of 10-20 µl). The samples and standards were then 
        408    loaded onto a native PAGE 3-12% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher, BN1001BOX) and 
        409    electrophoresis performed at 150 V for 3 h on ice. The gel was then placed in fixative solution 
        410    (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid), microwaved on high for 45 s, and then shaken on an orbital 
        411    shaker for 15 min at room temperature. After incubation, the gel was placed in destaining 
        412    solution (8% acetic acid), microwaved on high for 45 s, then incubated overnight at 4°C on an 
        413    orbital shaker. The gel was scanned for densitometry.

        490    Statistical Analyses 
        491    Data are presented as means ±SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad 
        492    Prism 7.03 software. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare two groups. For two-
        493    by-two comparisons, two-way ANOVA analyses were performed (main effect of genotype 
        494    shown over a horizontal line) followed by appropriate post-hoc tests corrected for multiple 
        495    comparisons. All tests were two-sided and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
